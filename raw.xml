    <title>The Ezra Klein Show</title>
    <description>*** Named a best podcast of 2021 by Time, Vulture and Esquire. ***
Each Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation on something that matters. How do we address climate change if the political system fails to act? Has the logic of markets infiltrated too many aspects of our lives? What is the future of the Republican Party? What do psychedelics teach us about consciousness? What does sci-fi understand about our present that we miss? Can our food system be just to humans and animals alike?</description>

      <title>Best Of: This Conversation Will Change How You Think About Thinking</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For decades, our society’s dominant metaphor for the mind has been a computer.

Annie Murphy Paul’s “<a href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/the-extended-mind/9780544947665">The Extended Mind”</a> argues, convincingly, that the human mind is contextual. It works differently in different environments, with different tools, amid different bodily states, among other minds.</p><p>Here’s the problem: Our schools, our workplaces, our society are built atop that bad metaphor. Activities and habits that we’ve been taught to associate with creativity and efficiency often stunt our thinking, and so much that we’ve been taught to dismiss — activities that look like leisure, play or rest — are crucial to thinking (and living!) well.</p><p>Paul’s book, read correctly, is a radical critique of not just how we think about thinking, but how we’ve constructed much of our society. In this conversation, originally released in July 2021, we discuss how the body can pick up on patterns before the conscious mind knows what it’s seen, why forcing kids (and adults) to “sit still” makes it harder for them to think clearly, the connection between physical movement and creativity, why efficiency is often the enemy of productivity, the restorative power of exposure to the natural world, the dystopian implications of massive cognitive inequality, why open-plan offices were a terrible idea and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CLATEM">"The extended mind"</a> by Andy Clark and David J.

      <title>Best Of: Why Sci-Fi Legend Ted Chiang Fears Capitalism, Not A.I.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For years, I’ve kept a list of dream guests for this show. And as long as that list has existed, Ted Chiang has been atop it.</p><p>Chiang is a science fiction writer. But that undersells him. He has released two short story collections over 20 years — 2002’s <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101972120">“Stories of Your Life and Others”</a> and 2019’s <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101947883">“Exhalation.”</a> Those stories have won more awards than I can list, and one of them was turned into the film “Arrival.” They are remarkable pieces of work: Each is built around a profound scientific, philosophical or religious idea, and then the story or the story structure is shaped to represent that idea. They are wonders of precision and craft. But unlike a lot of science fiction, they are never cold. Chiang’s work is deeply, irrepressibly humane.</p><p>I’ve always wondered about the mind that would create Chiang’s stories. And in this conversation, originally released in March 2021, I got to watch it in action. Chiang doesn’t like to talk about himself. But he does like to talk about ideas. And so we do: We discuss the difference between magic and technology, why superheroes fight crime but ignore injustice, what it would do to the human psyche if we knew the future is fixed, whether free will exists, whether we’d want to know the exact date of our deaths, why Chiang fears what humans will do to artificial intelligence more than what A.I. will do to humans, the way capitalism turns people against technology, and much more.</p><p>The ideas Chiang offered in this conversation are still ringing in my head months later, and changing the way I see the world.

      <title>Best Of: Noam Chomsky&apos;s Theory of the Good Life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How do you introduce Noam Chomsky? Perhaps you start here: In 1979, The New York Times<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/25/archives/the-chomsky-problem-chomsky.html"> called</a> him “arguably the most important intellectual alive today.” More than 40 years later, Chomsky, at 92, is still putting his dent in the world — writing books, giving interviews, changing minds.</p><p>There are different sides to Chomsky. He’s a world-renowned linguist who revolutionized his field. He’s a political theorist who’s been a sharp critic of American foreign policy for decades. He’s an anarchist who believes in a radically different way of ordering society. He’s a pragmatist who pushed leftists to vote for Joe Biden in 2020 and has described himself as having a “rather conservative attitude towards social change.” He is, very much, himself.</p><p>The problem in planning a conversation with Chomsky is how to get at all these different sides. So this one, from April 2021, covers a lot of ground. We discuss:</p><p>— Why Chomsky is an anarchist, and how he defines anarchism</p><p>— How his work on language informs his idea of what human beings want</p><p>— The role of advertising in capitalism</p><p>— Whether we should understand job contracts as the free market at work or a form of constant coercion</p><p>— How Chomsky’s ideal vision of society differs from Nordic social democracy</p><p>— How Chomsky’s class-based theory of politics holds up in an era where college-educated suburbanites are moving left on economics</p><p>— Chomsky’s view of the climate crisis and why he thinks the “degrowth” movement is misguided</p><p>— Whether job automation could actually be a good thing for human flourishing</p><p>— Chomsky’s views on US-China policy, and why he doesn’t think China is a major geopolitical threat</p><p>— The likelihood of nuclear war in the next decade</p><p>And much more. </p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode: </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anarchism-Noam-Chomsky/dp/1595589104/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/143-6270908-2694057?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1595589104&pd_rd_r=5d0fd414-5499-4534-9960-fa6b7b8b43cf&pd_rd_w=hyctE&pd_rd_wg=Vwy2n&pf_rd_p=337be819-13af-4fb9-8b3e-a5291c097ebb&pf_rd_r=FFKY9R76VA25SKKR5Z0P&psc=1&refRID=FFKY9R76VA25SKKR5Z0P">On Anarchism</a> by Noam Chomsky </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Climate-Crisis-Global-Green-Deal/dp/178873985X">Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal</a> by Noam Chomsky and Robert Pollin</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/opinion/amazon-union-alabama.html"> “Why the Amazon Workers Never Stood a Chance”</a> by Erik Loomis </p><p><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WRA516-1.html">“Trends in Income From 1975 to 2018”</a> by Carter C.

Perhaps you start here: In 1979, The New York Times called him “arguably the most important intellectual alive today.” More than 40 years later, Chomsky, at 92, is still putting his dent in the world — writing books, giving interviews, changing minds.

There are different sides to Chomsky. He’s a world-renowned linguist who revolutionized his field. He’s a political theorist who’s been a sharp critic of American foreign policy for decades. He’s an anarchist who believes in a radically different way of ordering society. He’s a pragmatist who pushed leftists to vote for Joe Biden in 2020 and has described himself as having a “rather conservative attitude towards social change.” He is, very much, himself.

The problem in planning a conversation with Chomsky is how to get at all these different sides. So this one, from April 2021, covers a lot of ground. We discuss:

— Why Chomsky is an anarchist, and how he defines anarchism

— How his work on language informs his idea of what human beings want

— The role of advertising in capitalism

— Whether we should understand job contracts as the free market at work or a form of constant coercion

— How Chomsky’s ideal vision of society differs from Nordic social democracy

— How Chomsky’s class-based theory of politics holds up in an era where college-educated suburbanites are moving left on economics

— Chomsky’s view of the climate crisis and why he thinks the “degrowth” movement is misguided

— Whether job automation could actually be a good thing for human flourishing

— Chomsky’s views on US-China policy, and why he doesn’t think China is a major geopolitical threat

— The likelihood of nuclear war in the next decade

And much more.

      <title>Timeless Wisdom for Leading a Life of Love, Friendship and Learning</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Today, we are supercompetent when it comes to efficiency, utility, speed, convenience, and getting ahead in the world; but we are at a loss concerning what it’s all for,” Leon Kass writes in his 2017 book “<a href="https://www.encounterbooks.com/books/leading-worthy-life/" target="_blank">Leading a Worthy Life</a>.” “This lack of cultural and moral confidence about what makes a life worth living is perhaps the deepest curse of living in our interesting time.”</p><p>Kass spent more than 30 years as an award-winning teacher at the University of Chicago, where he gained a reputation among students for his commitment to the big questions of human existence and the study of classic texts.

      <itunes:subtitle>“Today, we are supercompetent when it comes to efficiency, utility, speed, convenience, and getting ahead in the world; but we are at a loss concerning what it’s all for,” Leon Kass writes in his 2017 book “Leading a Worthy Life.” “This lack of cultural and moral confidence about what makes a life worth living is perhaps the deepest curse of living in our interesting time.”

Kass spent more than 30 years as an award-winning teacher at the University of Chicago, where he gained a reputation among students for his commitment to the big questions of human existence and the study of classic texts. And he’s written books and essays on marriage, sports, ethics, friendship, romance, the philosophy of food, biblical wisdom and more. In many ways, Kass’s career represents a lifelong effort to grapple with the biggest question of all: What does it mean to live a meaningful life?

This conversation, between Kass and the New York Times Opinion columnist David Brooks, is an attempt to answer that question. Along the way, they discuss the difference between choosing a career and discovering a vocation; the key ingredients of a successful romantic relationship; how to distinguish between superficial friendships and life-altering ones; why finding the right job is less about searching within ourselves and more about committing to something beyond ourselves; Kass’s view that the most distinctive thing about individuals isn’t their race, gender or class but “the ruling passions of their souls”; and what the biblical Exodus story can teach Americans about how to live together more harmoniously.

That means no guaranteed paid family leave, no universal child care or preschool and a patchwork system of elder and disability care that leaves millions without support.</p><p>American families are drowning as a result. In some states, the average cost of a full-time child-care program is nearing $20,000 a year; the median yearly cost of a private room in a nursing home is over $100,000 — a figure that well exceeds the median household income in the United States.

But for her, the current state of America’s care infrastructure is more than a looming crisis; it’s a huge opportunity — one that, if solved, could supercharge the American economy, ensure dignified care across our life spans and revolutionize the future of work.

      <title>Predicting the Future Is Possible. ‘Superforecasters’ Know How.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Can we predict the future more accurately?</p><p>It’s a question we humans have grappled with since the dawn of civilization — one that has massive implications for how we run our organizations, how we make policy decisions, and how we live our everyday lives.</p><p>It’s also the question that Philip Tetlock, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227815/superforecasting-by-philip-e-tetlock-and-dan-gardner/" target="_blank">Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction</a>,” has dedicated his career to answering. In 2011, he recruited and trained a team of ordinary citizens to compete in a forecasting tournament sponsored by the U.S. intelligence community. Participants were asked to place numerical probabilities from 0 to 100 percent on questions like “Will North Korea launch a new multistage missile in the next year” and “Is Greece going to leave the eurozone in the next six months?” Tetlock’s group of amateur forecasters would go head-to-head against teams of academics as well as career intelligence analysts, including those from the C.I.A., who had access to classified information that Tetlock’s team didn’t have.</p><p>The results were shocking, even to Tetlock. His team won the competition by such a large margin that the government agency funding the competition decided to kick everyone else out, and just study Tetlock’s forecasters — the best of whom were dubbed “superforecasters” — to see what intelligence experts might learn from them.</p><p>So this conversation is about why some people, like Tetlock’s “superforecasters,” are so much better at predicting the future than everyone else — and about the intellectual virtues, habits of mind, and ways of thinking that the rest of us can learn to become better forecasters ourselves. It also explores Tetlock’s famous finding that the average expert is roughly as accurate as “a dart-throwing chimpanzee” at predicting future events, the inverse correlation between a person’s fame and their ability to make accurate predictions, how superforecasters approach real-life questions like whether robots will replace white-collar workers, why government bureaucracies are often resistant to adopt the tools of superforecasting and more.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691178288/expert-political-judgment" target="_blank">Expert Political Judgment</a> by Philip E.

      <itunes:title>Predicting the Future Is Possible. ‘Superforecasters’ Know How.</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:52:51</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Can we predict the future more accurately?

It’s a question we humans have grappled with since the dawn of civilization — one that has massive implications for how we run our organizations, how we make policy decisions, and how we live our everyday lives.

It’s also the question that Philip Tetlock, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and a co-author of “Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction,” has dedicated his career to answering. In 2011, he recruited and trained a team of ordinary citizens to compete in a forecasting tournament sponsored by the U.S. intelligence community. Participants were asked to place numerical probabilities from 0 to 100 percent on questions like “Will North Korea launch a new multistage missile in the next year” and “Is Greece going to leave the eurozone in the next six months?” Tetlock’s group of amateur forecasters would go head-to-head against teams of academics as well as career intelligence analysts, including those from the C.I.A., who had access to classified information that Tetlock’s team didn’t have.

The results were shocking, even to Tetlock. His team won the competition by such a large margin that the government agency funding the competition decided to kick everyone else out, and just study Tetlock’s forecasters — the best of whom were dubbed “superforecasters” — to see what intelligence experts might learn from them.

So this conversation is about why some people, like Tetlock’s “superforecasters,” are so much better at predicting the future than everyone else — and about the intellectual virtues, habits of mind, and ways of thinking that the rest of us can learn to become better forecasters ourselves. It also explores Tetlock’s famous finding that the average expert is roughly as accurate as “a dart-throwing chimpanzee” at predicting future events, the inverse correlation between a person’s fame and their ability to make accurate predictions, how superforecasters approach real-life questions like whether robots will replace white-collar workers, why government bureaucracies are often resistant to adopt the tools of superforecasting and more.

      <title>Best Of: How Blue Cities Became So Outrageously Unaffordable</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden’s economic agenda is centered on a basic premise: The United States needs to build. To build roads and bridges. To build child care facilities and car-charging stations. To build public transit and affordable housing. And in doing so, to build a better future for everyone.</p><p>But there’s a twist of irony in that vision. Because right now, even in places where Democrats hold control over government, they are consistently failing to build cheaply, quickly and equitably. In recent decades, blue states and cities from Los Angeles to Boston to New York have become known for their outrageously expensive housing, massive homeless populations and infrastructure projects marred by major delays and cost overruns — all stemming from this fundamental inability to actually build.</p><p>Jerusalem Demsas is a policy reporter at Vox who covers a range of issues from housing to transportation. And the central question her work asks is this: Why is the party that ostensibly supports big government doing ambitious things constantly failing to do just that, even in the places where it holds the most power?</p><p>So this is a conversation about the policy areas where blue city and state governance is failing the most: housing, homelessness, infrastructure.

      <title>Why Is Murder Spiking? And Can Cities Address It Without Police?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In 2020 the United States experienced a nearly 30 percent rise in homicides from 2019. That’s the single biggest one-year increase since we started keeping national records in 1960. And violence has continued to rise well into 2021.</p><p>To deny or downplay the seriousness of this spike is neither morally justified nor politically wise. Violence takes lives, traumatizes children, instills fear, destroys community life and entrenches racial and economic inequality. Public opinion responds in kind:<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/"> Polling</a><a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/70_of_voters_say_crime_is_out_of_control"> indicates</a> that Americans are increasingly worried about violent crime. And if November’s state and local campaigns were any indication, public safety will be a defining issue in upcoming election cycles.</p><p>Liberals and progressives need an answer to the question of how to handle rising violence. But that answer doesn’t need to involve a return to the punitive, tough-on-crime approach that has devastated Black and brown communities for decades and led millions of people to take to the streets in protest last summer.</p><p>Patrick Sharkey is a sociologist at Princeton University and the author of<a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Uneasy-Peace/"> “Uneasy Peace: The Great Crime Decline, the Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence.”</a> The central claim of his work is this: Police are effective at reducing violence, but they aren’t the only actors capable of doing so. Sharkey has studied community-based models for addressing violence in places as varied as rural Australia and New York City.

      <itunes:summary>In 2020 the United States experienced a nearly 30 percent rise in homicides from 2019. That’s the single biggest one-year increase since we started keeping national records in 1960. And violence has continued to rise well into 2021.

To deny or downplay the seriousness of this spike is neither morally justified nor politically wise. Violence takes lives, traumatizes children, instills fear, destroys community life and entrenches racial and economic inequality. Public opinion responds in kind: Polling indicates that Americans are increasingly worried about violent crime. And if November’s state and local campaigns were any indication, public safety will be a defining issue in upcoming election cycles.

Liberals and progressives need an answer to the question of how to handle rising violence. But that answer doesn’t need to involve a return to the punitive, tough-on-crime approach that has devastated Black and brown communities for decades and led millions of people to take to the streets in protest last summer.

Patrick Sharkey is a sociologist at Princeton University and the author of “Uneasy Peace: The Great Crime Decline, the Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence.” The central claim of his work is this: Police are effective at reducing violence, but they aren’t the only actors capable of doing so. Sharkey has studied community-based models for addressing violence in places as varied as rural Australia and New York City. As a result, he has developed a compelling, evidence-backed vision of how cities and communities can tackle violent crime without relying heavily on police.

So this conversation is about what an alternative approach to addressing the current homicide spike could look like and all the messy, difficult questions it raises. It also explores the causes of the homicide spike, why Sharkey thinks policing is ultimately an “unsustainable” solution to crime, how New York City managed to reduce gun violence by 50 percent while reducing arrests and prison populations, whether it’s possible to overcome the punitive politics of rising crime, why America has such abnormally high levels of violent crime in the first place and more.

      <title>The Case Against Loving Your Job</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The compulsion to be happy at work “is always a demand for emotional work from the worker,” <a href="https://www.boldtypebooks.com/titles/sarah-jaffe/work-wont-love-you-back/9781568589398/" target="_blank">writes Sarah Jaffe</a>. “Work, after all, has no feelings.

So that’s where we begin: Why are so many Americans radically rethinking work?

We also discuss the rise of corporate virtue signaling, the threat that American consumerism poses for worker power, how the decline of religion could be contributing to the veneration of careers, why the term “burnout” doesn’t go far enough in describing the problems of modern work and how the logic of capitalism has shaped our notions of human value and self-worth.

      <itunes:subtitle>The compulsion to be happy at work “is always a demand for emotional work from the worker,” writes Sarah Jaffe. “Work, after all, has no feelings. Capitalism cannot love. This new work ethic, in which work is expected to give us something like self-actualization, cannot help but fail.”

Jaffe is a Type Media Center reporting fellow, a co-host of the podcast “Belabored” and the author of “Work Won’t Love You Back: How Devotion to Our Jobs Keeps Us Exploited, Exhausted and Alone.” Many of us, especially Gen Zers and millennials, have grown up with the idea that work should be more than just a way to make a living; it’s a vocation, a calling, a source of meaning and fulfillment. But for Jaffe, that idea is a scam, a con, a false promise. It prevents us from seeing work for what it really is: a power struggle over our time, our labor and our livelihoods.

So this is a conversation about the dissonance between our expectations of what work can offer our lives and the reality of what our jobs and careers are capable of delivering; about whether work can ever really love us back. But there’s a bigger picture here, too. Workers are quitting their jobs in record numbers. Strikes are taking place across the country. In her role as a labor reporter, Jaffe has spent much of the past year interviewing workers across the country — spanning industries from retail to health care to tech — giving her insight into the shift in attitudes behind this uproar in the labor market. So that’s where we begin: Why are so many Americans radically rethinking work?

We also discuss the rise of corporate virtue signaling, the threat that American consumerism poses for worker power, how the decline of religion could be contributing to the veneration of careers, why the term “burnout” doesn’t go far enough in describing the problems of modern work and how the logic of capitalism has shaped our notions of human value and self-worth.

      <title>It&apos;s Time for the Media to Choose: Neutrality or Democracy?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Making it harder to vote, and harder to understand what the party is really about — these are two parts of the same project” for the Republican Party, Jay Rosen <a href="https://pressthink.org/2020/11/the-coming-confrontation-between-the-american-press-and-the-republican-party/" target="_blank">writes</a>. “The conflict with honest journalism is structural. To be its dwindling self, the G.O.P. has to also be at war with the press, unless of course the press folds under pressure.”</p><p>Rosen is a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., author of the blog “<a href="https://pressthink.org/" target="_blank">PressThink</a>,” and one of America’s sharpest contemporary media critics. And his argument is a simple one: The media’s implicit model of American politics — of two coequal parties with competing governing philosophies — is fundamentally broken. Today, the most important axis of political conflict is not between left and right, but between pro- and anti-democracy forces.</p><p>The way Rosen sees it, the American mainstream press must make a choice: Will it double down on its commitment to detached, nonpartisan neutrality? Or will it choose instead to boldly and aggressively defend truth and democracy?</p><p>These days, Rosen’s view seems almost common-sensical. But he’s been critiquing “both sides” journalism — and the model of politics underlying it — for years now, long before such arguments came into vogue. As a result, he’s done some of the most original thinking about what an alternative model of journalism would look like, and wrestled with the inevitable political, social and economic tensions that come with it.</p><p>So this conversation is about what pro-democracy journalism could look like in practice and the thorny questions that this approach to coverage raises. But it also touches on the drawbacks of the press’s focus on Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema; how journalists should cover Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson; why Rosen believes “moderate” and “centrist” are “two of the most ideology-soaked terms” in political journalism; the consequences of an economy where political news has to compete for attention with Netflix, Xbox and TikTok; and why Substack and podcasting may hold one of the keys to restoring trust in the media.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p>“<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355526/americans-trust-media-dips-second-lowest-record.aspx" target="_blank">Americans’ Trust in Media Dips to Second Lowest on Record</a>” by Megan Brenan</p><p>“<a href="https://pressthink.org/2020/11/the-coming-confrontation-between-the-american-press-and-the-republican-party/" target="_blank">The Coming Confrontation Between the American Press and the Republican Party</a>” by Jay Rosen on PressThink</p><p>“<a href="https://pressthink.org/2020/06/battleship-newspaper/" target="_blank">Battleship Newspaper</a>” by Jay Rosen on PressThink</p><p>“<a href="https://pressthink.org/2018/11/election-coverage-the-road-not-taken/" target="_blank">Election Coverage: The Road Not Taken</a>” by Jay Rosen on PressThink</p><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democrats-build-back-better-americans-dont-know-opinion-poll/" target="_blank">CBS News poll on Build Back Better</a></p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/33899/the-boys-on-the-bus-by-timothy-crouse/" target="_blank">The Boys on the Bus</a> by Timothy Crouse</p><p><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Making-News/Gaye-Tuchman/9780029329603" target="_blank">Making News</a> by Gaye Tuchman</p><p><a href="https://nupress.northwestern.edu/9780810122376/deciding-whats-news/" target="_blank">Deciding What’s News</a> by Herbert Gans</p><p>This episode is guest-hosted by Nicole Hemmer, a historian whose work focuses on the right-wing media and American politics.

And his argument is a simple one: The media’s implicit model of American politics — of two coequal parties with competing governing philosophies — is fundamentally broken. Today, the most important axis of political conflict is not between left and right, but between pro- and anti-democracy forces.</p><p>The way Rosen sees it, the American mainstream press must make a choice: Will it double down on its commitment to detached, nonpartisan neutrality? Or will it choose instead to boldly and aggressively defend truth and democracy?</p><p>These days, Rosen’s view seems almost common-sensical. But he’s been critiquing “both sides” journalism — and the model of politics underlying it — for years now, long before such arguments came into vogue.

      <title>Two Acclaimed Writers on the Art of Revising Your Life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Many of the most contentious debates right now center on whether we, as individuals — and as a country — are willing to revise. To revise our understanding of history. To revise the kind of language we use. To revise the nature of our personal, and national, identities. To revise how we act in our everyday relationships.</p><p>Revision like this is often necessary, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Making fundamental changes to the way we think, speak and act requires the kind of self-scrutiny, discomfort and sacrifice that many of us would rather avoid.</p><p>There are few public figures who model revision — of one’s work and one’s life — as openly and honestly as Kiese Laymon. Laymon has written the prizewinning memoir <a href="https://www.kieselaymon.com/heavy" target="_blank">“Heavy”</a> as well as essays for The New York Times, ESPN and the Oxford American. His nonfiction tackles sports, popular culture, the politics of literary publishing and, above all, his home state of Mississippi. On every page, you’ll find wit, but also heart-stopping vulnerability and a reckoning with tough love: for himself, his kin, his community and the complicated places where he has spent his life.</p><p>Laymon has mastered the art of revising his own words. But for him, revision is also a moral, even a spiritual, act — a crucial part of becoming a loving and responsible human being. He is the first to admit that he is a work in progress, that each period of his life is a draft that can be improved. In a way, Laymon thinks of his entire life as an act of revision. And he nurtures a radical hope that America can change for the better, too.</p><p>This conversation focuses on how Laymon thinks about revision. But it also considers how he navigates a publishing world that often puts pressure on minority-group artists to suppress their full identities to appeal to white audiences, the way his writing pushes the boundaries of conventional genre and canon, why Americans have such a hard time reassessing ourselves and what we can gain from trying to change.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p><a href="https://www.adiavictoria.com/" target="_blank">"A Southern Gothic"</a> by Adia Victoria</p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/south-to-america-imani-perry?variant=39331608625186" target="_blank">South to America</a> by Imani Perry</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/672938/shoutin-in-the-fire-by-dante-stewart/" target="_blank">Shoutin' in the Fire</a> by Danté Stewart</p><p><a href="https://www.mahoganybooks.com/9781595911162" target="_blank">Abolition for the People</a> by Colin Kaepernick</p><p>This episode is guest-hosted by Tressie McMillan Cottom, a sociologist and writer whose work focuses on higher education policy, popular culture, race, beauty and more.

      <title>The Life-Altering Differences Between White and Black Debt</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Public policy in the United States often overlooks wealth. We tend to design, debate and measure our economic policies with regard to income alone, which blinds us to the ways prosperity and precarity tangibly function in people’s lives. And that blind spot can ultimately prevent us from addressing social inequality at its roots.</p><p>Take the debate over student loan cancellation. Cancellation is often framed as an economically regressive policy — an elite giveaway of sorts — with the majority of benefits going to individuals toward the top end of the income distribution. But that distributive picture flips when you look at wealth instead of income. <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/student-debt-cancellation-is-progressive/" target="_blank">One recent paper</a> found that if the federal government decided to forgive up to $50,000 in student loan debt, the average person in the 20th to 40th percentiles for household assets would receive more than four times as much debt cancellation as the average person in the top 10 percent.</p><p>Louise Seamster is a sociologist at the University of Iowa whose work focuses on the intersection of wealth, race, education and inequality. She’s one of the sharpest minds studying the way systems of wealth creation and depletion shape everything from the benefits of higher education to the barriers to racial equality to the nature of democratic citizenship. And her cutting-edge research on the student debt crisis and the racial wealth gap served as a major source of inspiration for Senator Elizabeth Warren’s $50,000 loan forgiveness plan.</p><p>This conversation begins with a discussion of the student debt crisis in particular: what it’s like to live with crushing levels of debt, the debate over whether cancellation is fair to those who have paid off their loans, why you can’t truly understand the student debt crisis without understanding the wealth dynamics that undergird it, how loan forgiveness would alter the racial wealth gap, what an entirely different model for funding higher education would look like and more.</p><p>But this discussion is also more broadly about what it means to think in terms of wealth — and its inverse, debt — and what a radically different picture that reveals about the American economy and society.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p>“<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0896920519894635" target="_blank">Racialized Debts: Racial Exclusion From Credit Tools and Information Networks</a>” by Raphaël Charron-Chénier and Louise Seamster</p><p>“<a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GDI_Administrative-Path-to-Student-Debt-Cancellation_201912.pdf" target="_blank">An Administrative Path to Student Debt Cancellation</a>” by Luke Herrine</p><p>“<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331600156_Black_Debt_White_Debt" target="_blank">Black Debt, White Debt</a>” by Louise Seamster</p><p>“<a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/student-debt-cancellation-is-progressive/" target="_blank">Student Debt Cancellation IS Progressive: Correcting Empirical and Conceptual Errors</a>” by Charlie Eaton, Adam Goldstein, Laura Hamilton and Frederick Wherry</p><p>“<a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/publications/student-debt-forgiveness-options-implications-for-policy-and-racial-equity/" target="_blank">Student Debt Forgiveness Options: Implications for Policy and Racial Equity</a>” by Raphaël Charron-Chenier, Louise Seamster, Tom Shapiro and Laura Sullivan</p><p>“<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2329496516686620">Predatory Inclusion and Education Debt: Rethinking the Racial Wealth Gap</a>” by Louise Seamster and Raphaël Charron-Chénier</p><p>“<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2332649218790989#abstract">Racial Disparities in Student Debt and the Reproduction of the Fragile Black Middle Class</a>” by Jason N.

But this discussion is also more broadly about what it means to think in terms of wealth — and its inverse, debt — and what a radically different picture that reveals about the American economy and society.

But that distributive picture flips when you look at wealth instead of income. One recent paper found that if the federal government decided to forgive up to $50,000 in student loan debt, the average person in the 20th to 40th percentiles for household assets would receive more than four times as much debt cancellation as the average person in the top 10 percent.

Louise Seamster is a sociologist at the University of Iowa whose work focuses on the intersection of wealth, race, education and inequality. She’s one of the sharpest minds studying the way systems of wealth creation and depletion shape everything from the benefits of higher education to the barriers to racial equality to the nature of democratic citizenship. And her cutting-edge research on the student debt crisis and the racial wealth gap served as a major source of inspiration for Senator Elizabeth Warren’s $50,000 loan forgiveness plan.

This conversation begins with a discussion of the student debt crisis in particular: what it’s like to live with crushing levels of debt, the debate over whether cancellation is fair to those who have paid off their loans, why you can’t truly understand the student debt crisis without understanding the wealth dynamics that undergird it, how loan forgiveness would alter the racial wealth gap, what an entirely different model for funding higher education would look like and more.

But this discussion is also more broadly about what it means to think in terms of wealth — and its inverse, debt — and what a radically different picture that reveals about the American economy and society.

      <title>Why This Conservative Wants a More Radical Republican Party</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Progressives understand that culture war means discrediting their opponents and weakening or destroying their institutions. Conservatives should approach the culture war with a similar realism,” Sohrab Ahmari <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2019/05/against-david-french-ism" target="_blank">writes</a>. “To recognize that enmity is real is its own kind of moral duty.”</p><p>Five years ago, Ahmari was a self-described “secular mainstream conservative” working for The Wall Street Journal. Now a contributing editor at The American Conservative and the recently departed op-ed editor at The New York Post, Ahmari has become a fierce critic of the Republican Party as it existed before the rise of Donald Trump, a champion of right-wing populist leaders like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and a devout Catholic who believes social conservatives need to take a far more aggressive posture in the culture war.</p><p>Ahmari may be singular, but he is not alone. His political evolution is a microcosm for the ways the American right as a whole has been radicalized in recent decades. Many conservatives today are animated by a profound sense of anxiety about the direction of the country: A feeling that something about the American project has gone deeply, terribly wrong. A visceral fear of a “woke” progressivism with seemingly unmatched cultural power and influence. And a willingness to endorse ideas and leaders once considered fringe.</p><p>But Ahmari isn’t just a critic. He’s also one of the leading conservative intellectuals trying to chart a post-Trump future for the Republican Party. One that fuses Bernie Sanders-style economic populism with an aggressive social conservatism that isn’t afraid to use the power of the state to enforce its vision of the common good.</p><p>So this conversation begins with Ahmari’s religious and political journey but also explores his heterodox political vision for the Republican Party, the surprising similarities in how radical feminists and religious traditionalists understand the legacy of the sexual revolution, his view that cultural and economic deregulation has decimated the American working class, the possibility of a left-right alliance around banning pornography, and why he views the cultural left and its corporate allies as a greater threat to American democracy than anything Donald Trump can offer.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p><a href="https://www.ignatius.com/From-Fire-by-Water-P3122.aspx" target="_blank">From Fire, by Water</a> by Sohrab Ahmari</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/623405/the-unbroken-thread-by-sohrab-ahmari/" target="_blank">The Unbroken Thread</a> by Sohrab Ahmari</p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://www.lbyr.com/titles/herge/the-adventures-of-tintin-volume-1/9780316359405/" target="_blank">The Adventures of Tintin</a> by Hergé</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/172779/the-charterhouse-of-parma-by-stendhal/" target="_blank">The Charterhouse of Parma</a> by Stendhal</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/206189/the-gnostic-religion-by-hans-jonas/" target="_blank">The Gnostic Religion</a> by Hans Jonas</p><p>This episode is guest-hosted by Ross Douthat, a New York Times columnist whose work focuses on politics, conservatism, religion and, more recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/opinion/lyme-disease-chronic-illness.html" target="_blank">chronic illness</a>.

      <title>Long Covid and the Blind Spots of American Medicine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the most frightening, least understood aspects of the coronavirus pandemic is what’s come to be known as “long Covid.” Stories abound of young, healthy adults who experienced mild or asymptomatic coronavirus infections and recovered fairly quickly, only to experience an onset of debilitating symptoms weeks or even months later. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/health/covid-19-patients.html" target="_blank">One major study</a> of almost two million Covid patients in the United States found that nearly a quarter sought medical treatment for new conditions one month or more after their initial infection.</p><p>Scientists still don’t fully understand what’s causing long Covid or how to best treat it. But in that sense, long Covid isn’t all that novel. Today, millions of Americans suffer from chronic illnesses set off by the body’s response to infections. Many of these conditions routinely go undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed. And even those who find their conditions identified correctly often struggle to find treatments that work for them.</p><p>“To have a poorly understood disease,” writes Meghan O’Rourke, “is to be brought up against every flaw in the U.S. health care system; to collide with the structural problems of a late-capitalist society that values productivity more than health; and to confront the philosophical problem of conveying an experience that lacks an accepted framework.”</p><p>O’Rourke, an award-winning journalist and poet and the editor of The Yale Review, has spent more than a decade of her life struggling with chronic illness, a journey she documents in her forthcoming book, “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317923/the-invisible-kingdom-by-meghan-orourke/" target="_blank">The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness</a>.” In it, O’Rourke uses her experience to illuminate the facets of American society that often remain invisible to the rest of us: the blind spots in our scientific and medical paradigms, the shortcomings of our individualistic ethos, the way economic inequalities show up in our bodies, our culture’s tendency to pathologize suffering.</p><p>So this conversation begins with long Covid and the debates surrounding it, which O’Rourke has done <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/04/unlocking-the-mysteries-of-long-covid/618076/" target="_blank">excellent reporting and writing on</a>.

      <itunes:title>Long Covid and the Blind Spots of American Medicine</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>01:24:04</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>One of the most frightening, least understood aspects of the coronavirus pandemic is what’s come to be known as “long Covid.” Stories abound of young, healthy adults who experienced mild or asymptomatic coronavirus infections and recovered fairly quickly, only to experience an onset of debilitating symptoms weeks or even months later. One major study of almost two million Covid patients in the United States found that nearly a quarter sought medical treatment for new conditions one month or more after their initial infection.

Scientists still don’t fully understand what’s causing long Covid or how to best treat it. But in that sense, long Covid isn’t all that novel. Today, millions of Americans suffer from chronic illnesses set off by the body’s response to infections. Many of these conditions routinely go undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed. And even those who find their conditions identified correctly often struggle to find treatments that work for them.

“To have a poorly understood disease,” writes Meghan O’Rourke, “is to be brought up against every flaw in the U.S. health care system; to collide with the structural problems of a late-capitalist society that values productivity more than health; and to confront the philosophical problem of conveying an experience that lacks an accepted framework.”

O’Rourke, an award-winning journalist and poet and the editor of The Yale Review, has spent more than a decade of her life struggling with chronic illness, a journey she documents in her forthcoming book, “The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness.” In it, O’Rourke uses her experience to illuminate the facets of American society that often remain invisible to the rest of us: the blind spots in our scientific and medical paradigms, the shortcomings of our individualistic ethos, the way economic inequalities show up in our bodies, our culture’s tendency to pathologize suffering.

So this conversation begins with long Covid and the debates surrounding it, which O’Rourke has done excellent reporting and writing on. But it is also about what it’s like to experience America’s hidden chronic illness epidemic firsthand, and what that epidemic reveals about the society that too often pretends it doesn’t exist.

      <title>What Keeping American Democracy Alive Looks Like</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the “Stop the Steal” campaign, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and the wave of voter suppression bills making their way through Republican legislatures across the country, the struggle for American democracy feels, for many, visceral and even existential. But for Martha S. Jones, a legal and cultural historian at Johns Hopkins University, the moment we find ourselves in is anything but an aberration.</p><p>“I’m not someone who tells stories about a Whiggish arc in which we are always getting better, doing better, improving upon,” Jones says. “Much of American history is a story about contest, about conflict, about disagreement over fundamental ideas and fundamental precepts, fundamental principles, like citizenship and voting rights.”</p><p>Jones has spent her career documenting the contestation over American democracy. Her 2018 book, “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/birthright-citizens/7A4BFAF68722E7EC837C2888C46E4434" target="_blank">Birthright Citizens</a>,” tells the story of how Black Americans in the 19th century fought to address the Constitution’s silence on the question of who counts as a citizen, ultimately securing the establishment of birthright citizenship through the 14th Amendment.

But it also explores the need to reimagine America’s true “founders,” how 19th- and 20th-century Black women were modeling intersectionality long before it became a buzzword, what current discussion around “Black women voters” gets wrong, how worried we should be about current threats to American democracy and much more.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p><a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9781469633312/a-voice-from-the-south/">A Voice from the South</a> by Anna J.

      <title>A Crypto Optimist and a Crypto Skeptic Walk Into a Podcast Studio</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been wanting to explore the world crypto and blockchain technologies could build on the show for a while. In certain ways, I’m an optimist: I think these technologies matter, and many of them will work. In other ways, I’m a skeptic: I’m unconvinced that their wide adoption will lead to the glittering, decentralized digital world that many crypto proponents imagine.</p><p>So this is a crypto conversation that goes way beyond Bitcoin. It’s about what will happen when we build the foundation for truly digital economies, with digital money, digital goods, and digital ownership. It’s about technologies that could unlock a renaissance of creativity or an orgy of commercialization. Or both. And it’s about whether we are mistaking problems of power for problems of technology, and what might happen if we fix the technologies without changing the power structures. As everyone in this debate agrees, we made a lot of mistakes with the internet we have. How do we avoid them on the internet we’re building?</p><p>My guest today is Katie Haun. Haun is a general partner at the venture firm A16Z, also known as Andreesen-Horowitz. She’s a former Supreme Court clerk and federal prosecutor who has focused on cybercrime and prosecuted corrupt agents involved in Silk Road, the first big darknet market. So she saw the dark side of crypto first, and now, at A16Z, she’s a leader of one of the biggest crypto venture funds there is. So this is a conversation about the world crypto might create, conducted with as little technical jargon as we could manage. Enjoy!</p><p>I also want to note that this will be the last episode I host until January. I’m going on paternity leave for the next few months, and we’re going to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/opinion/eks-guest-hosts.html" target="_blank">an absolutely all-star lineup</a> of guest hosts while I’m gone. That lineup will include Jamelle Bouie, Ross Douthat, Tressie McMillan Cottom, Nicole Hemmer, Heather McGhee, David Brooks, Julia Galef, and the one, the only, Rogé Karma.

And it’s about whether we are mistaking problems of power for problems of technology, and what might happen if we fix the technologies without changing the power structures. As everyone in this debate agrees, we made a lot of mistakes with the internet we have. How do we avoid them on the internet we’re building?

My guest today is Katie Haun. Haun is a general partner at the venture firm A16Z, also known as Andreesen-Horowitz. She’s a former Supreme Court clerk and federal prosecutor who has focused on cybercrime and prosecuted corrupt agents involved in Silk Road, the first big darknet market. So she saw the dark side of crypto first, and now, at A16Z, she’s a leader of one of the biggest crypto venture funds there is. So this is a conversation about the world crypto might create, conducted with as little technical jargon as we could manage. Enjoy!

I also want to note that this will be the last episode I host until January. I’m going on paternity leave for the next few months, and we’re going to have an absolutely all-star lineup of guest hosts while I’m gone. That lineup will include Jamelle Bouie, Ross Douthat, Tressie McMillan Cottom, Nicole Hemmer, Heather McGhee, David Brooks, Julia Galef, and the one, the only, Rogé Karma. I’m excited to be a listener and trust me, you should be too. 

One last bit of housekeeping: The Times’s Opinion section is looking for an editorial assistant to work with Michelle Goldberg and me on fact-checking our columns and doing some editorial research and clerical work. This is a great, entry-level role at The Times. It needs a year of journalism experience, and on my end, I’m particularly looking for candidates with a demonstrable obsession with policy analysis and social science research.

      <title>Lessons on Living Well, From Nick Offerman</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Nick Offerman is best known for his role as Ron Swanson, the mustachioed, libertarian outdoorsman who led the Pawnee, Ind., Parks and Recreation Department on the beloved show “Parks and Recreation.” But there’s more to Offerman than Swanson: His new book, “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/536915/where-the-deer-and-the-antelope-play-by-nick-offerman/" target="_blank">Where the Deer and the Antelope Play</a>,” was inspired in part by his conversation with the agrarian poet-philosopher Wendell Berry, and a hiking trip he took with the writer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-george-saunders.html" target="_blank">George Saunders</a> and the musician <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/02/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-jeff-tweedy.html" target="_blank">Jeff Tweedy</a> (both of whom you may remember from past episodes of this show).</p><p>Offerman is fascinating. He plays, inhabits and ultimately subverts a kind of camp masculinity. Some of it is real. He really does own a woodworking shop. He really did release a whiskey with Lagavulin. But some of it is a container Offerman is using to try to get people to think about different ways to live. Like his famed character, Offerman loves the outdoors and thinks we’ve lost touch with the role it should play in our lives and the role it has played in our past. That’s the subject of his book, and to some degree, of this conversation. But Offerman is also just a wonderful storyteller and possessed of a generous, earthy wisdom.

      <title>How to Do the Most Good</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Do we actually know how much good our charitable donations do?</p><p>This is the question that jump-started Holden Karnofsky’s current career. He was working at a hedge fund and wanted to figure out how to give his money away with the certainty that it would save as many lives as possible. But he couldn’t find a service that would help him do that, so he and his co-worker Elie Hassenfeld decided to quit their jobs to build one. The result was GiveWell, a nonprofit that measures the effectiveness of different charities and recommends the ones it is most confident can save lives with the least cost. Things like providing bed nets to prevent malaria and treatments to deworm schoolchildren in low-income countries.</p><p>But in recent years, Karnofsky has taken a different approach. He is currently the co-C.E.O. of Open Philanthropy, which operates under the same basic principle — how can we do the most good possible? — but with a very different theory of how to do so. Open Phil’s areas of funding range from farm animal welfare campaigns and criminal justice reform to pandemic preparedness and A.I. safety. And Karnofsky has recently written a series of blog posts centered around the idea that, ethically speaking, we’re living through the most important century in human history: The decisions we make in the coming decades about transformational technologies will determine the fate of trillions of future humans.</p><p>In all of this, Karnofsky represents the twin poles of a movement that’s come to deeply influence my thinking: effective altruism. The hallmark of that approach is following fundamental questions about how to do good through to their conclusions, no matter how simple or fantastical the answers. And so this is a conversation, at a meta-level, about how to think like an effective altruist. Along the way, we discuss everything from climate change to animal welfare to evaluating charities to artificial intelligence to the hard limits of economic growth to trying to view the world as if you were a billion years old.</p><p>You probably won’t agree with every prediction in here, but that is, in a way, the point: We live in a weird world that’s only getting weirder, and we need to be able to entertain both the obvious and the outlandish implications.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do we actually know how much good our charitable donations do?</p><p>This is the question that jump-started Holden Karnofsky’s current career. He was working at a hedge fund and wanted to figure out how to give his money away with the certainty that it would save as many lives as possible. But he couldn’t find a service that would help him do that, so he and his co-worker Elie Hassenfeld decided to quit their jobs to build one. The result was GiveWell, a nonprofit that measures the effectiveness of different charities and recommends the ones it is most confident can save lives with the least cost. Things like providing bed nets to prevent malaria and treatments to deworm schoolchildren in low-income countries.</p><p>But in recent years, Karnofsky has taken a different approach. He is currently the co-C.E.O. of Open Philanthropy, which operates under the same basic principle — how can we do the most good possible? — but with a very different theory of how to do so. Open Phil’s areas of funding range from farm animal welfare campaigns and criminal justice reform to pandemic preparedness and A.I. safety. And Karnofsky has recently written a series of blog posts centered around the idea that, ethically speaking, we’re living through the most important century in human history: The decisions we make in the coming decades about transformational technologies will determine the fate of trillions of future humans.</p><p>In all of this, Karnofsky represents the twin poles of a movement that’s come to deeply influence my thinking: effective altruism. The hallmark of that approach is following fundamental questions about how to do good through to their conclusions, no matter how simple or fantastical the answers. And so this is a conversation, at a meta-level, about how to think like an effective altruist. Along the way, we discuss everything from climate change to animal welfare to evaluating charities to artificial intelligence to the hard limits of economic growth to trying to view the world as if you were a billion years old.</p><p>You probably won’t agree with every prediction in here, but that is, in a way, the point: We live in a weird world that’s only getting weirder, and we need to be able to entertain both the obvious and the outlandish implications.

      <title>Eric Adams Has a Message for the Democratic Party</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In July, Eric Adams narrowly won the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York, making him the odds-on favorite to win in November. And he won the nomination by running directly against the verities of today’s progressives: asserting that the police are the answer, not the problem; that “defund the police” misjudged what communities of color actually want; that Democrats had lost touch with the multiracial working-class voters they claim to represent.</p><p>Adams won on that message. He won in deep-blue New York City. It’s made him a national figure, and he’s been emphatic on what that means. “I am the face of the new Democratic Party,” he said. And “if the Democratic Party fails to recognize what we did here in New York, they’re going to have a problem in the midterm elections and they’re going to have a problem in the presidential election.”</p><p>When politicians become national stories, they often release, or rerelease, a book. Adams is no exception. But instead of a campaign manifesto or an autobiography, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/652065/healthy-at-last-by-eric-adams/" target="_blank">“Healthy at Last”</a> is a book about the health benefits of plant-based eating. “Outspoken vegan” isn’t a political identity I tend to associate with ambitious politicians at odds with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, but that’s Adams for you. He doesn’t shy away from a fight.</p><p>In this conversation, Adams and I talk about the fights he is picking, or will have to pick, in the coming years: with progressives who he thinks have lost their way, with police unions he wants to reform, with wealthy communities where he wants to build more housing, with critics who think plant-based eating is a hobby for foodie elites and with voters who may not be willing to wait for Adams’s “upstream” approach to social problems to pay off.</p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/652065/healthy-at-last-by-eric-adams/" target="_blank">Healthy At Last</a> by Eric Adams</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/603255/breaking-the-habit-of-being-yourself-by-dr-joe-dispenza/" target="_blank">Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself</a> by Joe Dispenza</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/601354/you-are-the-placebo-by-dr-joe-dispenza/9781401944599/" target="_blank">You Are The Placebo</a> by Joe Dispenza</p><p><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Upstream/Dan-Heath/9781982134723" target="_blank">Upstream</a> by Dan Heath</p><p><a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear</p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast"> nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast</a>, and you can find Ezra on Twitter @ezraklein.

      <title>This Conversation With Richard Powers Is a Gift</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There are certain conversations I fear trying to fit into a description. There’s just more to them than I’m going to be able to convey. This is one of them.</p><p>Richard Powers is the author of 13 novels, including the 2019 Pulitzer Prize-winning <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393356687">“The Overstory.”</a> If you haven’t read it, you should. It’ll change you. It changed me. I haven’t walked through a forest the same way again. And I’m not alone in that.

      <itunes:summary>There are certain conversations I fear trying to fit into a description. There’s just more to them than I’m going to be able to convey. This is one of them.

Richard Powers is the author of 13 novels, including the 2019 Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Overstory.” If you haven’t read it, you should. It’ll change you. It changed me. I haven’t walked through a forest the same way again. And I’m not alone in that. When I interviewed Barack Obama this year, he recommended “The Overstory,” saying, “It changed how I thought about the earth and our place in it.”

Powers’s new book is “Bewilderment.” You could think of it as &apos;The Innerstory&apos;: It is about how and whether we see the world we inhabit. It’s about the nature and limits of our empathy. It’s about refusing to die before we’re dead and taking seriously the gifts and responsibilities of being alive. It is about how we change our minds and how we change our societies. It is about how we treat delusion as normal and clarity as lunacy. It is enchanting, and it is devastating.

It is not just books through which Powers has been exploring these ideas. It is also through radical changes he’s made to how he lives his life. That’s where we start but far from where we end: This conversation touches on mortality, animism, politics, old-growth forests, extraterrestrial life, Buddhism and beyond.

      <itunes:title>We’re on the Precipice of a Post-Roe World</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:59:56</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court let stand a Texas law creating a system of vigilante legal enforcement against anyone who participates in an abortion after the point of fetal cardiac activity. In effect, Texas’ law bans abortions after about six weeks, which is long before many women even know they’re pregnant. And soon the court will hear arguments on a Mississippi abortion ban that will give the justices the chance to overturn Roe v. Wade directly.

We may be on the precipice of a post-Roe world.

But what does that actually mean? Leslie Reagan is the author of “When Abortion Was a Crime” and “Dangerous Pregnancies.” Reagan has done groundbreaking historical work to reveal what happened when U.S. states began criminalizing abortion in the early 19th century. There are lessons in our past that should inform our future, if we’ll listen.

This is also a particularly personal episode for me.My partner is 33 weeks pregnant. This is our second pregnancy. Both have been unusually dangerous and physically damaging. For the state to say that it will force any people to undergo that against their will is a remarkable assumption of power over individuals. Reagan and I talk about what that means, what the state is saying about the personhood, or lack thereof, of those who become pregnant.

      <title>How Colson Whitehead Writes About Our ‘Big Wild Country’</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“If he got a thrill out of transforming these ill-gotten goods into legit merchandise, a zap-charge in his blood like he’d plugged into a socket, he was in control of it and not the other way around,” writes Colson Whitehead in his new novel, “Harlem Shuffle.” “Dizzying and powerful as it was. Everyone had secret corners and alleys that no one else saw — what mattered were your major streets and boulevards, the stuff that showed up on other people’s maps of you.”</p><p>Whitehead is the author of “The Underground Railroad,” which won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and “The Nickel Boys,” which also won a Pulitzer, the first time two consecutive books by an author won. But he actually started “Harlem Shuffle” in between those two books. And now that he’s finished it, he can’t quite put it down. He’s working on a sequel, he told me. The first time he’s tried one.</p><p>“Harlem Shuffle” is both a joyous and a troubled book. It’s built around Ray Carney, a furniture salesman and fence for stolen goods, and a series of capers around 1960s-era Harlem. But at its core it’s about patrimony, capitalism, ambition, race and the moral costs of striving in an unjust system.</p><p>We talk about all that, and more: how Marvel Comics made Whitehead want to be a writer, how parenthood changed him, why he hopes to distill it all down to a haiku, whether the writing world is a just or unjust system, the nature of zombies, the nonfiction of the late-Aughts internet, the legacy of 9/11, his favorite heist movies, what his wife thinks his characters know that he doesn’t — and I could keep going.</p><p>This one’s a fun one.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2009/02/wow-fiction-works/" target="_blank">"Wow, Fiction Works!"</a> by Colson Whitehead</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/608669/harlem-shuffle-by-colson-whitehead/" target="_blank">Harlem Shuffle</a> by Colson Whitehead</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/232365/the-underground-railroad-by-colson-whitehead/" target="_blank">The Underground Railroad</a> by Colson Whitehead</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/223161/the-nickel-boys-by-colson-whitehead/" target="_blank">The Nickel Boys</a> by Colson Whitehead</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/189758/zone-one-by-colson-whitehead/" target="_blank">Zone One</a> by Colson Whitehead</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/189755/sag-harbor-by-colson-whitehead/9780307455161/readers-guide/" target="_blank">Sag Harbor</a> by Colson Whitehead</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/223158/the-noble-hustle-by-colson-whitehead/" target="_blank">The Noble Hustle</a> by Colson Whitehead</p><p>Book recommendations: </p><p><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/love-goes-to-buildings-on-fire-five-years-in-new-york-that-changed-music-forever/9780374533540" target="_blank">Love Goes to Buildings on Fire</a> by Will Hermes</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/211811/the-buddha-in-the-attic-by-julie-otsuka/" target="_blank">The Buddha in the Attic</a> by Julie Otsuka</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouseaudio.com/book/125388/when-the-emperor-was-divine/" target="_blank">When the Emperor Was Divine</a> by Julie Otsuka</p><p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250062246" target="_blank">Mad As Hell</a> by Dave Itzkoff</p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast"> nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast</a>, and you can find Ezra on Twitter @ezraklein.

      <itunes:duration>00:56:35</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>“If he got a thrill out of transforming these ill-gotten goods into legit merchandise, a zap-charge in his blood like he’d plugged into a socket, he was in control of it and not the other way around,” writes Colson Whitehead in his new novel, “Harlem Shuffle.” “Dizzying and powerful as it was. Everyone had secret corners and alleys that no one else saw — what mattered were your major streets and boulevards, the stuff that showed up on other people’s maps of you.”

Whitehead is the author of “The Underground Railroad,” which won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and “The Nickel Boys,” which also won a Pulitzer, the first time two consecutive books by an author won. But he actually started “Harlem Shuffle” in between those two books. And now that he’s finished it, he can’t quite put it down. He’s working on a sequel, he told me. The first time he’s tried one.

“Harlem Shuffle” is both a joyous and a troubled book. It’s built around Ray Carney, a furniture salesman and fence for stolen goods, and a series of capers around 1960s-era Harlem. But at its core it’s about patrimony, capitalism, ambition, race and the moral costs of striving in an unjust system.

We talk about all that, and more: how Marvel Comics made Whitehead want to be a writer, how parenthood changed him, why he hopes to distill it all down to a haiku, whether the writing world is a just or unjust system, the nature of zombies, the nonfiction of the late-Aughts internet, the legacy of 9/11, his favorite heist movies, what his wife thinks his characters know that he doesn’t — and I could keep going.

This one’s a fun one.

      <title>Tyler Cowen on the Great Stagnation’s End</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Tyler Cowen is an economist at George Mason University, the co-founder of the blog Marginal Revolution, and host of the podcast “Conversations With Tyler.” But more than that, he’s a genuine polymath who reads about everything, goes everywhere and talks to everyone. I’ve known him for years, and while I disagree with him on quite a bit, there are few people I learn more from in a single conversation.</p><p>In this conversation, I wanted to get at the connective thread in Cowen’s work: the moral imperative of economic growth. Growth doesn’t have the best reputation in left-wing circles these days, and often for good reason. It’s hard to look at a world where rising G.D.P. has driven rising temperatures and shocking inequality, and then to continue venerating growth as an all-encompassing good.</p><p>Cowen admits those criticisms — particularly the climate one — but still argues that growth, properly measured, is central to a moral economy. The East Asian economic miracles are, he’s written, “the highest manifestation of the ethical good in human history to date.” Time, he argues, is a “moral illusion,” and the most important thing we can do for the future is set the power of compounding growth to work now. We do that by generating new ideas, new technologies, new ways of living and cooperating. And that, in turn, requires us to find and nurture human talent, which is where his recent work has focused.</p><p>So we begin this conversation by discussing the case for and against economic growth, but we also get into lots of other things: why Cowen thinks the great stagnation in technology is coming to an end; the future of technologies like A.I., crypto, fourth-generation nuclear and the Chinese system of government; the problems in how we fund scientific research; what the right has done to make government both ineffective and larger; why Cowen is skeptical of universal pre-K (and why I’m not); whether I overestimate the dangers of polarization; the ways in which we’re getting weirder; the long-term future of human civilization; why reading is overrated and travel is underrated; how to appreciate classical music and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/265612/the-great-stagnation-by-tyler-cowen/">The Great Stagnation</a> by Tyler Cowen </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1534253238&sr=1-1&keywords=stubborn+attachments">Stubborn Attachments</a> by Tyler Cowen </p><p><a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/aer.20110236">“Beyond GDP?

      <title>Can We Change Our Sexual Desires? Should We?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Feminists have long dreamed of sexual freedom,” writes Amia Srinivasan. “What they refuse to accept is its simulacrum: sex that is said to be free, not because it is equal, but because it is ubiquitous.”</p><p>Srinivasan is an Oxford philosopher who, in 2018, wrote the viral essay “<a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v40/n06/amia-srinivasan/does-anyone-have-the-right-to-sex" target="_blank">Does Anyone Have the Right to Sex?</a>” Her piece was inspired by Elliot Rodger’s murderous rampage and the misogynist manifesto he published to justify it. But Srinivasan’s inquiry opened out to larger questions about the relationship between sex and status, what happens when we’re undesired for unjust reasons and whether we can change our own preferences and passions. The task, as she frames it, is “not imagining a desire regulated by the demands of justice, but a desire set free from the binds of injustice.” I love that line.</p><p>Srinivasan’s new book of essays, “The Right to Sex,” includes that essay alongside other challenging pieces considering consent, pornography, student-professor relationships, sex work and the role of law in regulating all of those activities. This is a conversation about topics we don’t always cover on this show, but that shape the world we all live in: Monogamy and polyamory, the nature and malleability of desire, the interplay between sex and status-seeking, what it would mean to be sexually free, the relationship between inequality and modern dating, incels, the feminist critique of porn, how the internet has transformed the sexual culture for today’s young people and much more.</p><p>(One note: This conversation was recorded before the Supreme Court permitted a Texas law prohibiting abortions after six weeks, arguably ushering in the post-Roe era.

This is a conversation about topics we don’t always cover on this show, but that shape the world we all live in: Monogamy and polyamory, the nature and malleability of desire, the interplay between sex and status-seeking, what it would mean to be sexually free, the relationship between inequality and modern dating, incels, the feminist critique of porn, how the internet has transformed the sexual culture for today’s young people and much more.

      <itunes:summary>We asked for your questions, and you answered. Hundreds and hundreds of fantastic questions poured in, and our producer Annie Galvin joined me to ask some of the best of them. Does the infrastructure bill mean there’s more hope for bipartisanship than we thought? What’s my view on the degrowth movement? What do I think my book, “Why We’re Polarized,” got right, and what did it get wrong? Will plant- and cell-based meats ever be cheaper than eating animals, given the subsidies the meat industry gets? Why hasn’t any blue state created a single-payer health care system? Can you really build more housing without creating a biodiversity crisis?

We also get into reading habits, comic books, meditation, children’s books, why I spend a lot of time thinking about death and much more. So here it is: the “Ask Me Anything” episode.

      <title>This Conversation Will Change How You Think About Trauma</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“Trauma is much more than a story about something that happened long ago,” writes Dr. Bessel van der Kolk. “The emotions and physical sensations that were imprinted during the trauma are experienced not as memories but as disruptive physical reactions in the present.”</p><p>Van der Kolk, a psychiatrist by training, has been a pioneer in trauma research for decades now and leads the Trauma Research Foundation. His 2014 book<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/313183/the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk-md/"> “The Body Keeps the Score,”</a> quickly became a touchstone on the topic. And although the book was first released seven years ago, it now sits at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list, a testament to the state of our national psyche.</p><p>The core argument of the book is that traumatic experiences — everything from sexual assault and incest to emotional and physical abuse — become embedded in the older, more primal parts of our brain that don’t have access to conscious awareness. And that means two things simultaneously. First, that trauma lodges in the body. We carry a physical imprint of our psychic wounds. The body keeps the score. But — and I found this more revelatory — the mind <i>hides</i> the score. It obscures the memories, or convinces us our victimization was our fault, or covers the event in shame so we don’t discuss it.</p><p>There’s a lot in this conversation. We discuss the lived experience of trauma, the relationship between the mind and the body, the differences between our “experiencing” and “autobiographical” selves, why van der Kolk believes human language is both a “miracle” and a “tyranny,” unconventional treatments for trauma from<a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/eye-movement-reprocessing"> E.M.D.R.</a> and yoga to psychedelics and theater, how societies can manage collective trauma like 9/11 and Covid-19, the shortcomings of America’s “post-alcoholic” approach to dealing with psychic suffering, how to navigate the often complex relationships with the traumatized people we know and love, and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9635069/">“The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study”</a> by Vince Felitti et al.</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17284128/">Study on efficacy of EMDR</a></p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31221820/">“REBUS and the Anarchic Brain: Toward a Unified Model of the Brain Action of Psychedelics”</a> by Robin Carhart-Harris et al. </p><p>Book Recommendations:</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/apology-9781635574395">The Apology</a> by V </p><p><a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/deborah-blum/love-at-goon-park/9780465026012/">Love in Goon Park</a> by Deborah Blum</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/237108/the-narrow-road-to-the-deep-north-by-richard-flanagan/">The Narrow Road to the Deep North</a> by Richard Flanagan </p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast, and you can find Ezra on Twitter @ezraklein.</p><p>Thoughts?

His 2014 book “The Body Keeps the Score,” quickly became a touchstone on the topic. And although the book was first released seven years ago, it now sits at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list, a testament to the state of our national psyche.

The core argument of the book is that traumatic experiences — everything from sexual assault and incest to emotional and physical abuse — become embedded in the older, more primal parts of our brain that don’t have access to conscious awareness. And that means two things simultaneously. First, that trauma lodges in the body. We carry a physical imprint of our psychic wounds. The body keeps the score. But — and I found this more revelatory — the mind hides the score. It obscures the memories, or convinces us our victimization was our fault, or covers the event in shame so we don’t discuss it.

There’s a lot in this conversation. We discuss the lived experience of trauma, the relationship between the mind and the body, the differences between our “experiencing” and “autobiographical” selves, why van der Kolk believes human language is both a “miracle” and a “tyranny,” unconventional treatments for trauma from E.M.D.R. and yoga to psychedelics and theater, how societies can manage collective trauma like 9/11 and Covid-19, the shortcomings of America’s “post-alcoholic” approach to dealing with psychic suffering, how to navigate the often complex relationships with the traumatized people we know and love, and much more.

With the U.S. government puzzling over U.F.O.s, and potentially habitable exoplanets in our telescopes, earthlings are closer than ever to finding other intelligent life in the universe. So the existential question is: Should we try to communicate with whatever we think might be out there?

That’s the argument this week between Douglas Vakoch and Michio Kaku. Vakoch, the president of the research and educational nonprofit METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence) International, has dedicated his life’s work to intentionally broadcasting messages beyond our solar system.

Kaku, a professor of theoretical physics at the City College of New York and a co-founder of string field theory, thinks reaching out to unknown aliens is a catastrophically bad idea and “would be the biggest mistake in human history.”

Together, they join Jane  to debate the question of making first contact and our place in the cosmos.

Mentioned in this episode:

Adam Mann, The New Yorker: “Intelligent Ways to Search for Extraterrestrials”

Gideon Lewis-Kraus, The New Yorker: “How the Pentagon Started Taking U.F.O.s Seriously”

Arik Kershenbaum, The Wall Street Journal, “Alien Languages May Not Be Entirely Alien to Us”

      <title>Best of: George Saunders on Kindness in a Cruel World</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We’re taking a week off from releasing new episodes, so today I wanted to re-up one of my favorite episodes of the show, a conversation with fiction writer George Saunders that covers much more than just his writing.</p><p>Saunders is one of America’s greatest living writers. He’s the author of dozens of critically acclaimed short stories, including his 2013 collection, “Tenth of December”;<i> </i>his debut novel, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/231506/lincoln-in-the-bardo-by-george-saunders/">“Lincoln in the Bardo,”</a> won the 2017 Booker Prize; and his nonfiction work has empathy and insight that leave pieces from more than a decade ago ringing in my head today. His most recent book, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609280/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-by-george-saunders/">“A Swim in A Pond in the Rain,”</a> is a literary master class built around seven Russian short stories, analyzing how they work, and what they reveal about how we work.</p><p>I’ve wanted to interview Saunders for more than 15 years. I first saw him talk when I was in college, and there was a quality of compassion and consideration in every response that was, well, strange. His voice doesn’t sound like his fiction. His fiction is bitingly satirical, manic, often unsettling. His voice is calm, kind, gracious. The dissonance stuck with me.</p><p>Saunders’s central topic, literalized in <a href="https://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/george-saunderss-advice-to-graduates/">his famous 2013 commencement speech</a>, is about what it means to be kind in an unkind world. And that’s the organizing question of this conversation, too. We discuss the collisions between capitalism and human relations, the relationship between writing and meditation, Saunders’s personal editing process, the tension between empathizing with others and holding them to account, the promise of re-localizing our politics, the way our minds deceive us, Tolstoy’s unusual theory of personal transformation and much more.</p><p>What a pleasure this conversation was.

      <itunes:title>Best of: George Saunders on Kindness in a Cruel World</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>01:15:52</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>We’re taking a week off from releasing new episodes, so today I wanted to re-up one of my favorite episodes of the show, a conversation with fiction writer George Saunders that covers much more than just his writing.

Saunders is one of America’s greatest living writers. He’s the author of dozens of critically acclaimed short stories, including his 2013 collection, “Tenth of December”; his debut novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” won the 2017 Booker Prize; and his nonfiction work has empathy and insight that leave pieces from more than a decade ago ringing in my head today. His most recent book, “A Swim in A Pond in the Rain,” is a literary master class built around seven Russian short stories, analyzing how they work, and what they reveal about how we work.

I’ve wanted to interview Saunders for more than 15 years. I first saw him talk when I was in college, and there was a quality of compassion and consideration in every response that was, well, strange. His voice doesn’t sound like his fiction. His fiction is bitingly satirical, manic, often unsettling. His voice is calm, kind, gracious. The dissonance stuck with me.

Saunders’s central topic, literalized in his famous 2013 commencement speech, is about what it means to be kind in an unkind world. And that’s the organizing question of this conversation, too. We discuss the collisions between capitalism and human relations, the relationship between writing and meditation, Saunders’s personal editing process, the tension between empathizing with others and holding them to account, the promise of re-localizing our politics, the way our minds deceive us, Tolstoy’s unusual theory of personal transformation and much more.

What a pleasure this conversation was. So worth the wait.

      <title>How Identity Politics Took Over the Republican Party</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>One problem with the conversation around political polarization is that it can imply that polarization is a static, singular thing. That our divisions are fixed and unchanging. But that’s not how it is at all. The dimensions of conflict change, and they change quickly.

Her 2018 book, “Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity,” is, in my view, one of the most important political books of the last decade. But it’s been a tumultuous three and a half years since it was published. And Mason has continued to pump out important new work on political identity, how support for Donald Trump differs from that of other Republicans, when Democrats and Republicans believe political violence is justifiable and even necessary, and much more.

In “Reign of Terror,” Ackerman takes all he’s reported on and wraps it into one sweeping argument: We are still in the 9/11 era, and that’s all the more true because we’ve come to take so much of it for granted.

We discuss the connection between Sept. 11 and birtherism, the scope of mass surveillance, the ethics of drone strikes, how Trump understood the war on terror’s moral core better than its architects did, the messy choices of national security, the ways America’s belief in its own innocence makes it less safe, Barack Obama’s complicated relationship with the fight against terrorism, the emergence of a genuinely left-wing foreign policy movement, the coalescing bipartisan consensus around a cold war with China, and much more.

      <itunes:subtitle>The Sept, 11 attacks might have taken place almost 20 years ago, but we’re still living in the America that the war on terror built. Its legacy is not just mass surveillance and drone strikes but birtherism, nativism and Donald Trump. And much of it has been — and continues to be — a bipartisan effort.

That’s the argument of Spencer Ackerman’s new book, “Reign of Terror.” Ackerman is the author of the newsletter Forever Wars, a contributing editor at The Daily Beast, and a member of the Pulitzer Prize-winning team at The Guardian that reported on Edward Snowden’s surveillance revelations.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>“The war has changed.” That’s what the leaked C.D.C. document says about the way the Delta variant has upended our coronavirus policies. Delta is astonishingly contagious. It can generate 1,000 times the viral load of the original coronavirus strain, and it spreads with the ease of chickenpox. The vaccinated can no longer assume immunity. The unvaccinated are at more risk than ever. Masks are back. New York City is essentially imposing a vaccine mandate.</p><p>I have so many questions about the war we’re now in. What do we actually know about Delta? If you’re vaccinated, is it more or less likely to kill you than the flu? Is it more serious for children? Are we re-masking to protect the unvaccinated, or is this also for the vaccinated? What are the risks of long Covid for the vaccinated? I could go on.</p><p>Luckily, Dr. Céline Gounder has answers. Gounder is an epidemiologist at N.Y.U. medical school, a CNN medical analyst and host of the Covid podcast “Epidemic.” I’m not sure if this conversation will make you feel better about the war we’re now in.

      <title>41 Questions For The Technologies We Use, and That Use Us</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>We all know by now that Zoom causes fatigue, social media spreads misinformation and Google Maps is wiping out our sense of direction. We also know, of course, that Zoom allows us to cooperate across continents, that social media connects us to our families and Google Maps keeps us from being lost. A lot of technological criticism today is about weighing whether a technology is good or bad, or judging its various uses. But there’s an older tradition of criticism that asks a more fundamental and nuanced question: How do these technologies change the people who use them, both for good and for bad? And what do the people who use them — all of us, in other words — actually want? Do we even know?</p><p>L.M. Sacasas explores these questions in his great newsletter, <a href="https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/" target="_blank">“The Convivial Society.”</a> His work is marrying the theorists of the 20th century — Hannah Arendt, C.S. Lewis, Ivan Illich, Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman and more — to the technologies of the present day. I’ve found this merging of past thinkers and contemporary concerns revelatory in an era when we tend to take the shape of our world for granted and forget how it would look to those who stood outside it, or how it looked to those who were there at the inception of these tools and mediums.</p><p>Sacasas recently published a list of 41 questions we should ask of the technologies and tools that shape our lives. What I loved about these questions is how they invite us to think not just about technologies, but about ourselves, and how we act and what we want and what, in the end, we truly value.

      <title>Nikole Hannah-Jones and Ta-Nehisi Coates on the Fight Over U.S. History</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>You’ve heard plenty by now about the fights over teaching critical race theory and the 1619 Project. But behind those skirmishes is something deeper: A fight over the story we tell about America. Why that fight has so gripped our national discourse is the question of this podcast: What changes when a country’s sense of its own history changes? What changes when who gets to tell that story changes? What are the stakes here, and why now?</p><p>My guests for this conversation need little introduction. Nikole Hannah-Jones is an investigative journalist for the New York Times Magazine where she led the 1619 Project, and, before that, did incredible work on racial inequality in the American education system. Ta- Nehisi Coates is the author of books including “Between the World and Me” and “The Water Dancer,” essays including “The Case for Reparations,” and, for Marvel Comics, “Captain America” and “Black Panther.” Each of them has won more prestigious awards for their work than I could possibly list here, and both will be taking faculty positions at Howard University.</p><p>We discuss the 1619 Project, whether patriotism can coexist with shame and regret, the political power of American exceptionalism, the cracked foundations of American democracy, how journalism is and should be taught, our relationships to Twitter, what journalists can learn from children and much more.</p><p>Nikole Hannah-Jones book recommendations: </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-Reconstruction-America-1860-1880-Burghardt/dp/0684856573">Black Reconstruction in America, 1860-1880</a> by W.E.B Du Bois</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/190696/the-warmth-of-other-suns-by-isabel-wilkerson/">The Warmth of Other Suns</a> by Isabel Wilkerson</p><p>Ta-Nehisi Coates book recommendations: </p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292994/postwar-by-tony-judt/">Postwar</a> by Tony Judt </p><p><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674018266">Avengers of the New World</a> by Laurent Dubois</p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast, and you can find Ezra on Twitter @ezraklein.</p><p>Thoughts?

      <title>How Blue Cities Became So Outrageously Unaffordable</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Joe Biden’s economic agenda is centered on a basic premise: The United States needs to build. To build roads and bridges. To build child care facilities and car-charging stations. To build public transit and affordable housing. And in doing so, to build a better future for everyone.</p><p>But there’s a twist of irony in that vision. Because right now, even in places where Democrats hold control over government, they are consistently failing to build cheaply, quickly and equitably.

Annie Murphy Paul’s “<a href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/the-extended-mind/9780544947665">The Extended Mind”</a> argues, convincingly, that the human mind is contextual.

Activities and habits that we’ve been taught to associate with creativity and efficiency often stunt our thinking, and so much that we’ve been taught to dismiss — activities that look like leisure, play or rest — are crucial to thinking (and living!) well.</p><p>Paul’s book, read correctly, is a radical critique of not just how we think about thinking, but how we’ve constructed much of our society. In this conversation, we discuss how the body can pick up on patterns before the conscious mind knows what it’s seen, why forcing kids (and adults) to “sit still” makes it harder for them to think clearly, the connection between physical movement and creativity, why efficiency is often the enemy of productivity, the restorative power of exposure to the natural world, the dystopian implications of massive cognitive inequality, why open-plan offices were a terrible idea and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CLATEM">"The extended mind"</a> by Andy Clark and David J.

      <title>Ibram X. Kendi on What Conservatives—and Liberals—Get Wrong About Antiracism</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“What if instead of a feelings advocacy we had an outcome advocacy that put equitable outcomes before our guilt and anguish?” wrote Ibram X. Kendi in his 2019 book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/564299/how-to-be-an-antiracist-by-ibram-x-kendi/" target="_blank">How to Be an Antiracist</a>.” “What if we focused our human and fiscal resources on changing power and policy to actually make society, not just our feelings, better?”</p><p>When I first read “How to Be an Antiracist” in the fall of 2019, I was struck by Kendi’s relentless focus on outcomes. For him, racism wasn’t about what you intended, or what you felt. If a given policy or action reduced racial inequality, it was antiracist; if it increased racial inequality, it was racist. If you support policies that reduce racial inequality you are being antiracist; if you aren’t, you’re being racist. That’s it.</p><p>These days, Kendi needs little introduction. “How to Be an Antiracist” has become one of the signature texts of the post-George Floyd moment. And Kendi himself has become a central figure of the antiracist movement, having launched a vast array of projects, from his new podcast, “<a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/show/be-antiracist-ibram-kendi/" target="_blank">Be Antiracist</a>,” to his children’s book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624774/antiracist-baby-picture-book-by-ibram-x-kendi-illustrated-by-ashley-lukashevsky/" target="_blank">Antiracist Baby</a>” to his Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University.</p><p>But I’ve often wondered about the genuine radicalism of Kendi’s work as it has phased from book to phenomenon. There are certainly some people who are doing the real, hard analytical and empirical work that Kendi actually calls for. But a lot of what occurs under the banner of “antiracism” is putting up yard signs, publicly acknowledging privilege and issuing statements of solidarity without the consequentialist analysis he demands.</p><p>So I wanted to have a conversation that really took Kendi’s approach to antiracism seriously. Spoiler alert: It’s hard. We discuss policy issues ranging from police defunding to open borders and interest rates, the research on corporate diversity and inclusion trainings, the political tradeoffs of Barack Obama’s presidency, the cases where a policy might reduce racial inequality but the backlash to it might increase it, the right-wing assault on critical race theory, visions of a positive-sum racial future and much more.</p><p>References:</p><p><a href="https://www.boldtypebooks.com/titles/ibram-x-kendi/stamped-from-the-beginning/9781568585987/" target="_blank">Stamped from the Beginning</a> by Ibram X.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“What if instead of a feelings advocacy we had an outcome advocacy that put equitable outcomes before our guilt and anguish?” wrote Ibram X. Kendi in his 2019 book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/564299/how-to-be-an-antiracist-by-ibram-x-kendi/" target="_blank">How to Be an Antiracist</a>.” “What if we focused our human and fiscal resources on changing power and policy to actually make society, not just our feelings, better?”</p><p>When I first read “How to Be an Antiracist” in the fall of 2019, I was struck by Kendi’s relentless focus on outcomes. For him, racism wasn’t about what you intended, or what you felt. If a given policy or action reduced racial inequality, it was antiracist; if it increased racial inequality, it was racist. If you support policies that reduce racial inequality you are being antiracist; if you aren’t, you’re being racist. That’s it.</p><p>These days, Kendi needs little introduction. “How to Be an Antiracist” has become one of the signature texts of the post-George Floyd moment. And Kendi himself has become a central figure of the antiracist movement, having launched a vast array of projects, from his new podcast, “<a href="https://www.pushkin.fm/show/be-antiracist-ibram-kendi/" target="_blank">Be Antiracist</a>,” to his children’s book “<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/624774/antiracist-baby-picture-book-by-ibram-x-kendi-illustrated-by-ashley-lukashevsky/" target="_blank">Antiracist Baby</a>” to his Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University.</p><p>But I’ve often wondered about the genuine radicalism of Kendi’s work as it has phased from book to phenomenon. There are certainly some people who are doing the real, hard analytical and empirical work that Kendi actually calls for. But a lot of what occurs under the banner of “antiracism” is putting up yard signs, publicly acknowledging privilege and issuing statements of solidarity without the consequentialist analysis he demands.</p><p>So I wanted to have a conversation that really took Kendi’s approach to antiracism seriously. Spoiler alert: It’s hard. We discuss policy issues ranging from police defunding to open borders and interest rates, the research on corporate diversity and inclusion trainings, the political tradeoffs of Barack Obama’s presidency, the cases where a policy might reduce racial inequality but the backlash to it might increase it, the right-wing assault on critical race theory, visions of a positive-sum racial future and much more.</p><p>References:</p><p><a href="https://www.boldtypebooks.com/titles/ibram-x-kendi/stamped-from-the-beginning/9781568585987/" target="_blank">Stamped from the Beginning</a> by Ibram X.

      <title>How Octopuses Upend What We Know About Ourselves</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve spent the past few months on an octopus kick. In that, I don’t seem to be alone. Octopuses (it’s incorrect to say “octopi,” to my despair) are having a moment: There are award-winning books, documentaries and even science fiction about them. I suspect it’s the same hunger that leaves many of us yearning to know aliens: How do radically different minds work? What is it like to be a truly different being living in a similar world? The flying objects above remain unidentified. But the incomprehensible objects below do not. We are starting to be smart enough to ask the question: How smart are octopuses? And what are their lives like?</p><p>Sy Montgomery is a naturalist and the author of dozens of books on animals. In 2015 she published the dazzling book “<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Soul-of-an-Octopus/Sy-Montgomery/9781451697711">The Soul of an Octopus</a>,” which became a finalist for the National Book Award in nonfiction. It’s an investigation not only into the lives and minds of octopuses but also into the relationships they can and do have with human beings.</p><p>This was one of those conversations that are hard to describe, but it was a joy to have. Montgomery writes and speaks with an appropriate sense of wonder about the world around us and the other animals that inhabit it. This is a conversation about octopuses, of course, but it’s also about us: our minds, our relationship with the natural world, what we see and what we’ve learned to stop seeing.

She is a public educator in the broadest sense of the term.

I wanted to see how one person’s mind keeps all of these projects straight, and how Ewing’s sociology connects to her poetry and comic books. One thread that unites Ewing’s work is that she is often seeking out knowledge in unexpected places and challenging her audience to think about whose experiences and insights we treat as valid when debating policy. Our conversation touched on the role of public schools in low-income communities, quantitative versus “emotional” data, the limits of objectivity in debates, critical race theory and how it can inform politics, her Afrofuturist poetry that looks forward and backward in time, the cultural significance of comics, her feelings about Tony Stark and more.

      <title>Best of: What ‘Drained-Pool’ Politics Costs America</title>

      <title>Why Do We Work So Damn Much?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Historically speaking, we live in an age of extraordinary abundance. We have long since passed the income thresholds when<a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf"> past economists</a> believed our needs would be more than met and we’d be working 15-hour weeks, puzzling over how to spend our free time. And yet, few of us feel able to exult in leisure, and even many of today’s rich toil as if the truest reward for work is more work. Our culture of work would be profoundly puzzling to those who came before us.</p><p>James Suzman is an anthropologist who has spent the last 30 years living with and studying the Ju/’hoansi people of southern Africa, one of the world’s enduring hunter-gatherer societies. And that project has given him a unique lens on our modern obsession with work.</p><p>As Suzman documents in his new book,<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/599857/work-by-james-suzman/"> “Work: A Deep History From the Stone Age to the Age of Robots,”</a> hunter-gatherer societies like the Ju/’hoansi spent only about 15 hours a week meeting their material needs despite being deeply impoverished by modern standards. But as we’ve gotten richer and invented more technology, we’ve developed a machine for generating new needs, new desires, new forms of status competition.</p><p>So this is a conversation about the past, present and future of humanity’s relationship to work and to want. We discuss what economists get wrong about scarcity, the lessons hunter-gatherer societies can teach us about desire, how the advent of farming radically altered people’s conceptions of work and time, whether there’s such a thing as human nature, the dangers of social and economic inequality, the role of advertising in shaping human desires, whether we should have a wealth tax and universal basic income, and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/smith/econ116a/keynes1.pdf">“Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren”</a> by John Maynard Keynes</p><p><a href="http://www.econ.uzh.ch/static/wp_iew/iewwp344.pdf">“‘Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren’ 75 Years after: A Global Perspective”</a> by Fabrizio Zilibotti</p><p><a href="https://hbr.org/2006/12/extreme-jobs-the-dangerous-allure-of-the-70-hour-workweek">“Extreme Jobs: The Dangerous Allure of the 70-Hour Workweek”</a> by Sylvia Ann Hewlett and Carolyn Buck Luce</p><p>Book recommendations:  </p><p><a href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/king-leopolds-ghost/9780358212508">King Leopold's Ghost</a> by Adam Hochschild</p><p><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566795/entangled-life-by-merlin-sheldrake/">Entangled Life</a> by Merlin Sheldrake</p><p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374537197">Other Minds</a> by Peter Godfrey-Smith </p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast, and you can find Ezra on Twitter @ezraklein.</p><p>Thoughts?

      <itunes:duration>01:22:47</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Historically speaking, we live in an age of extraordinary abundance. We have long since passed the income thresholds when past economists believed our needs would be more than met and we’d be working 15-hour weeks, puzzling over how to spend our free time. And yet, few of us feel able to exult in leisure, and even many of today’s rich toil as if the truest reward for work is more work. Our culture of work would be profoundly puzzling to those who came before us.

James Suzman is an anthropologist who has spent the last 30 years living with and studying the Ju/’hoansi people of southern Africa, one of the world’s enduring hunter-gatherer societies. And that project has given him a unique lens on our modern obsession with work.

As Suzman documents in his new book, “Work: A Deep History From the Stone Age to the Age of Robots,” hunter-gatherer societies like the Ju/’hoansi spent only about 15 hours a week meeting their material needs despite being deeply impoverished by modern standards. But as we’ve gotten richer and invented more technology, we’ve developed a machine for generating new needs, new desires, new forms of status competition.

So this is a conversation about the past, present and future of humanity’s relationship to work and to want. We discuss what economists get wrong about scarcity, the lessons hunter-gatherer societies can teach us about desire, how the advent of farming radically altered people’s conceptions of work and time, whether there’s such a thing as human nature, the dangers of social and economic inequality, the role of advertising in shaping human desires, whether we should have a wealth tax and universal basic income, and much more.

      <title>Sarah Schulman’s Radical Approach to Conflict, Communication and Change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sarah Schulman’s work — as a nonfiction writer, novelist, activist, playwright and filmmaker — confronts the very thing most people try to avoid: conflict. Schulman, far from running from it, believes we need more of it.</p><p>This was true in Schulman’s 2016 book, “Conflict Is Not Abuse,” which argues that people often mislabel conflict as abuse without recognizing the power that they have to potentially abuse others. Viewing oneself as a victim can be one way to earn compassion. But powerful groups often use their perceived victimhood as an excuse to harm those who are more vulnerable. And more individually, people often don’t see when they have power, and they often fear or dodge the work of repair. It’s a challenging and prescient book, with a deep faith in the healing power of not just communication, but of collision.</p><p>Schulman’s latest book, “Let the Record Show,” is a history of ACT UP New York, the direct-action group that reshaped AIDS activism in the late ’80s and early ’90s. It’s a book about necessary conflicts: between the AIDS community and the U.S. government, and between queer people and a widely homophobic society. But it’s also about conflict among people who generally agree with one another and are working toward a common goal. Schulman calls the book “a political history,” but it’s also a work of political theory: a proposal for how social movements can become more effective by embracing dissensus rather than striving for consensus.</p><p>We began this conversation discussing ACT UP, conflict and Schulman’s theory of political change. But we also ended up discussing Israel and Palestine, a topic she has written widely about. And Schulman shares her thoughts on contemporary L.G.B.T.Q. politics and what she thinks has been lost as queer culture has become more mainstream.</p><p>Mentioned in this episode: </p><p><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374185138">Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP New York, 1987-1993</a> by Sarah Schulman </p><p><a href="https://arsenalpulp.com/Books/C/Conflict-Is-Not-Abuse">Conflict Is Not Abuse: Overstating Harm, Community Responsibility, and the Duty of Repair</a> by Sarah Schulman</p><p>Recommendations: </p><p><a href="https://www.dukeupress.edu/poor-queer-studies">Poor Queer Studies: Confronting Elitism in the University</a> by Matt Brim</p><p><a href="https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/martha-s-jones/vanguard/9781541618619/">Vanguard: How Black Women Broke Barriers, Won the Vote, and Insisted on Equality for All</a> by Martha S.

      <itunes:title>Sarah Schulman’s Radical Approach to Conflict, Communication and Change</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>01:01:27</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Sarah Schulman’s work — as a nonfiction writer, novelist, activist, playwright and filmmaker — confronts the very thing most people try to avoid: conflict. Schulman, far from running from it, believes we need more of it.

This was true in Schulman’s 2016 book, “Conflict Is Not Abuse,” which argues that people often mislabel conflict as abuse without recognizing the power that they have to potentially abuse others. Viewing oneself as a victim can be one way to earn compassion. But powerful groups often use their perceived victimhood as an excuse to harm those who are more vulnerable. And more individually, people often don’t see when they have power, and they often fear or dodge the work of repair. It’s a challenging and prescient book, with a deep faith in the healing power of not just communication, but of collision.

Schulman’s latest book, “Let the Record Show,” is a history of ACT UP New York, the direct-action group that reshaped AIDS activism in the late ’80s and early ’90s. It’s a book about necessary conflicts: between the AIDS community and the U.S. government, and between queer people and a widely homophobic society. But it’s also about conflict among people who generally agree with one another and are working toward a common goal. Schulman calls the book “a political history,” but it’s also a work of political theory: a proposal for how social movements can become more effective by embracing dissensus rather than striving for consensus.

We began this conversation discussing ACT UP, conflict and Schulman’s theory of political change. But we also ended up discussing Israel and Palestine, a topic she has written widely about. And Schulman shares her thoughts on contemporary L.G.B.T.Q. politics and what she thinks has been lost as queer culture has become more mainstream.

      <title>Welcome to the ‘Take This Job and Shove It’ Economy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is a strange moment in the economy. Wages are up, but so is inflation. Jobs are growing, but maybe not fast enough. Quit rates are at a 21st-century high. It isn’t clear what’s a trend, what’s a blip, what’s a transition and what’s now normal. And all this as the virus continues to stalk us and we process the trauma of the last 18 months.</p><p>“We all will have various times in our life where we’ll stop and say, ‘Whoa — am I going in the right direction? Is this the right occupation for me? Should I do something differently?’” says Betsey Stevenson. “But I can’t think of any other time when it’s been a correlated shock across the entire country, where we’ve all been faced — no, forced — to ask questions.”</p><p>Stevenson is an economist, and a highly accomplished one at that. She served as the chief economist of Barack Obama’s Department of Labor and later a member of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. Now she’s a professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan, as well as co-host of the podcast “Think Like an Economist.” She has a rare talent to blend a rigorous approach to labor market economics with a recognition that people — our psychologies and fears and dreams — matter, and they shape our economic decisions. Particularly now.</p><p>So I invited Stevenson on the show to discuss the big picture of what’s happening right now in the U.S. economy — wages, employment, inflation and the animal spirits driving much of it.

      <itunes:summary>Free minds. Freedom fries. Free speech. The Freedom Caucus. Freedom from. Freedom to. What do Americans really mean when they talk about freedom?

Louis Menand’s “The Free World” is a 700-plus-page intellectual history of the Cold War period that traces the opening of the American mind to new ideas in art, literature, politics, music, foreign policy, criticism, higher education and campus activism. John Cage was making silent music, Jackson Pollock was throwing paint on canvases, Pauline Kael was giving us permission to actually enjoy movies. Thinkers like James Baldwin, Isaiah Berlin and Hannah Arendt were arguing over what it meant to be free. Liberatory movements were trying to actually make Americans free. But what did it all get us?

      <title>Sam Altman on the A.I. Revolution, Trillionaires and the Future of Political Power</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“The technological progress we make in the next 100 years will be far larger than all we’ve made since we first controlled fire and invented the wheel,” writes Sam Altman in his essay<a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/"> “Moore’s Law for Everything.”</a> “This revolution will generate enough wealth for everyone to have what they need, if we as a society manage it responsibly.”</p><p>Altman is the C.E.O. of OpenAI, one of the biggest, most important players in the artificial intelligence space. His argument is this: Since the 1970s, computers have gotten exponentially better even as they’re gotten cheaper, a phenomenon known as Moore’s Law. Altman believes that A.I. could get us closer to Moore’s Law for everything: it could make everything better even as it makes it cheaper. Housing, health care, education, you name it.</p><p>But what struck me about his essay is that last clause: “if we as a society manage it responsibly.” Because, as Altman also admits, if he is right then A.I. will generate phenomenal wealth largely by destroying countless jobs — that’s a big part of how everything gets cheaper — and shifting huge amounts of wealth from labor to capital. And whether that world becomes a post-scarcity utopia or a feudal dystopia hinges on how wealth, power and dignity are then distributed — it hinges, in other words, on politics.</p><p>This is a conversation, then, about the political economy of the next technological age. Some of it is speculative, of course, but some of it isn’t. That shift of power and wealth is already underway. Altman is proposing an answer: a move toward taxing land and wealth, and distributing it to all. We talk about that idea, but also the political economy behind it: Are the people gaining all this power and wealth really going to offer themselves up for more taxation? Or will they fight it tooth-and-nail?</p><p>We also discuss who is funding the A.I. revolution, the business models these systems will use (and the dangers of those business models), how A.I. would change the geopolitical balance of power, whether we should allow trillionaires, why the political debate over A.I. is stuck, why a pro-technology progressivism would also need to be committed to a radical politics of equality, what global governance of A.I. could look like, whether I’m just “energy flowing through a neural network,” and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://moores.samaltman.com/">“Moore’s Law for Everything”</a> by Sam Altman</p><p>Recommendations: </p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Nights-Other-Stories-Greg/dp/1596062401">Crystal Nights</a> by Greg Egan</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Question-When-World-Ends/dp/1884214495">The Last Question</a> by Isaac Asimov</p><p><a href="http://www.skyhunter.com/marcs/GentleSeduction.html">The Gentle Seduction</a> by Marc Stiegler</p><p><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">“Meditations on Moloch”</a> by Scott Alexander </p><p>If you enjoyed this episode, check out <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/is-a-i-the-problem-or-are-we/id1548604447?i=1000524209501">our previous conversation “Is A.I. the Problem?

      <title>Employers Are Begging for Workers. Maybe That’s a Good Thing.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>There has been a bit of panic lately over employers who say not enough people want to apply for open jobs. Are we facing a labor shortage? Have stimulus checks and expanded unemployment insurance payments created an economy full of people who don’t want to work — and who are holding back the economic recovery? That’s one theory, anyway. But it’s leading to real policy change: 25 Republican governors have cut off expanded unemployment benefits early.</p><p>You can also tell a different story: The continuing threat of the coronavirus and the ongoing traumas and child care disruptions mean lots of workers don’t feel safe taking jobs in poorly ventilated spaces. Others may be using their stimulus checks and unemployment benefits to let them find a better job than they had before the pandemic, insisting on better pay and conditions. And if so — isn’t that a policy success?</p><p>This is a moment when an implicit but ugly fact of our economy has been thrown into unusual relief: Our economy relies on poverty — or at least the threat of it — to force people to take bad jobs at low wages. This gets couched in paeans to the virtues of work, but the truth is more instrumental. The country likes cheap goods and plentiful services, and it can’t get them without a lot of people taking jobs that higher-income Americans would never, ever consider. When we begin to see glimmers of worker power in the economy, a lot of powerful people freak out, all at once.</p><p>Jamila Michener is an associate professor of government at Cornell University and a co-director of Cornell’s Center for Health Equity. She does remarkable research on the intersection of race, poverty and public policy and speaks about all of it with uncommon humanity. We discuss the role of poverty in the economy, cultural narratives around work and deservingness, why the less-well-off masses don’t band together politically, how social programs disempower and humiliate the very people they’re ostensibly supposed to help, why it would be so hard to sell a universal basic income, whether the Biden administration’s economic agenda represents a sharp break from those of past administrations and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fragmented-democracy/9A69DF1567190EF38883D4766EBC0AAC">“Fragmented Democracy: Medicaid, Federalism, and Unequal Politics”</a> by Jamila Michener </p><p>Book recommendations: </p><p><a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/reuben-jonathan-miller/halfway-home/9781549173332/">Halfway Home</a> by Reuben Miller</p><p><a href="https://nyupress.org/9781613320198/root-shock/">Root Shock</a> by Mindy Fullilove</p><p><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/poorly-understood-9780190881382?cc=us&lang=en&">Poorly Understood</a> by Mark Rank, Lawrence Eppard, and Heather Bullock</p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast">nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast</a>, and you can find Ezra on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ezraklein">@ezraklein</a>.</p><p>Thoughts?

      <itunes:title>Employers Are Begging for Workers. Maybe That’s a Good Thing.</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>01:03:52</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>There has been a bit of panic lately over employers who say not enough people want to apply for open jobs. Are we facing a labor shortage? Have stimulus checks and expanded unemployment insurance payments created an economy full of people who don’t want to work — and who are holding back the economic recovery? That’s one theory, anyway. But it’s leading to real policy change: 25 Republican governors have cut off expanded unemployment benefits early.

You can also tell a different story: The continuing threat of the coronavirus and the ongoing traumas and child care disruptions mean lots of workers don’t feel safe taking jobs in poorly ventilated spaces. Others may be using their stimulus checks and unemployment benefits to let them find a better job than they had before the pandemic, insisting on better pay and conditions. And if so — isn’t that a policy success?

This is a moment when an implicit but ugly fact of our economy has been thrown into unusual relief: Our economy relies on poverty — or at least the threat of it — to force people to take bad jobs at low wages. This gets couched in paeans to the virtues of work, but the truth is more instrumental. The country likes cheap goods and plentiful services, and it can’t get them without a lot of people taking jobs that higher-income Americans would never, ever consider. When we begin to see glimmers of worker power in the economy, a lot of powerful people freak out, all at once.

      <title>Obama Explains How America Went From ‘Yes We Can’ to ‘MAGA’</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“My entire politics is premised on the fact that we are these tiny organisms on this little speck floating in the middle of space,” Barack Obama told me, sitting in his office in Washington, D.C.</p><p>To be fair, I was the one who had introduced the cosmic scale, asking how proof of alien life would change his politics. But Obama, in a philosophical mood, used the question to trace his view of humanity. “The differences we have on this planet are real,” he said. “They’re profound. And they cause enormous tragedy as well as joy. But we’re just a bunch of humans with doubts and confusion. We do the best we can. And the best thing we can do is treat each other better, because we’re all we got.”</p><p>Before our interview, I’d read <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/562882/a-promised-land-by-barack-obama/">“A Promised Land,”</a> the first volume of Obama’s presidential memoirs. It had left me thinking about the central paradox of Obama’s political career. He accomplished one of the most remarkable acts of political persuasion in American history, convincing the country to vote, twice, for a liberal Black man named Barack Hussein Obama during the era of the war on terror. But he left behind a country that is less persuadable, more polarized, and more divided. The Republican Party, of course, became a vessel for the Tea Party, for Sarah Palin, for Donald Trump — a direct challenge to the pluralistic, democratic politics Obama practiced. But the left, too, has struggled with the limits of Obama’s presidency, coming to embrace a more confrontational and unsparing approach to politics.</p><p>So this is a conversation with Obama about both the successes and failures of his presidency. We talk about his unusual approach to persuasion, when it’s best to leave some truths unsaid, the media dynamics that helped fuel both his and Trump’s campaigns, how to reduce educational polarization, why he believes Americans have become less politically persuadable, the mistakes he believes were made in the design of the 2009 stimulus and the Affordable Care Act, the ways in which Biden is completing the policy changes begun in the Obama administration, what humans are doing now that we will be judged for most harshly in 100 years, and more.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/13/13848794/kentucky-obamacare-trump">“Why Obamacare enrollees voted for Trump”</a> by Sarah Kliff, Vox</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/11/28/by-2040-two-thirds-of-americans-will-be-represented-by-30-percent-of-the-senate/">“By 2040, two-thirds of Americans will be represented by 30 percent of the Senate”</a> by Philip Bump, The Washington Post </p><p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/advantage-gop/">“Advantage, GOP”</a> by Laura Bronner and Nathaniel Rakich, FiveThirtyEight</p><p><strong>Recommendations: </strong></p><p><a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393356687">"The Overstory"</a> by Richard Powers</p><p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/memorial-drive-natasha-trethewey?variant=32306154635298">"Memorial Drive"</a> by Natasha Tretheway</p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast">nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast</a>, and you can find Ezra on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ezraklein">@ezraklein</a>.</p><p>Thoughts?

      <itunes:summary>“My entire politics is premised on the fact that we are these tiny organisms on this little speck floating in the middle of space,” Barack Obama told me, sitting in his office in Washington, D.C.

To be fair, I was the one who had introduced the cosmic scale, asking how proof of alien life would change his politics. But Obama, in a philosophical mood, used the question to trace his view of humanity. “The differences we have on this planet are real,” he said. “They’re profound. And they cause enormous tragedy as well as joy. But we’re just a bunch of humans with doubts and confusion. We do the best we can. And the best thing we can do is treat each other better, because we’re all we got.”

Before our interview, I’d read “A Promised Land,” the first volume of Obama’s presidential memoirs. It had left me thinking about the central paradox of Obama’s political career. He accomplished one of the most remarkable acts of political persuasion in American history, convincing the country to vote, twice, for a liberal Black man named Barack Hussein Obama during the era of the war on terror. But he left behind a country that is less persuadable, more polarized, and more divided. The Republican Party, of course, became a vessel for the Tea Party, for Sarah Palin, for Donald Trump — a direct challenge to the pluralistic, democratic politics Obama practiced. But the left, too, has struggled with the limits of Obama’s presidency, coming to embrace a more confrontational and unsparing approach to politics.

So this is a conversation with Obama about both the successes and failures of his presidency. We talk about his unusual approach to persuasion, when it’s best to leave some truths unsaid, the media dynamics that helped fuel both his and Trump’s campaigns, how to reduce educational polarization, why he believes Americans have become less politically persuadable, the mistakes he believes were made in the design of the 2009 stimulus and the Affordable Care Act, the ways in which Biden is completing the policy changes begun in the Obama administration, what humans are doing now that we will be judged for most harshly in 100 years, and more.

      <title>Violent Crime Is Spiking. Do Liberals Have an Answer?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Early estimates find that in 2020, homicides in the United States <a href="https://www.vox.com/22344713/murder-violent-crime-spike-surge-2020-covid-19-coronavirus">increased</a> somewhere between 25 percent and nearly 40 percent, the largest spike <a href="https://twitter.com/Crimealytics/status/1343951801175961603">since 1960</a>, when formal crime statistics began to be collected. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/upshot/murder-rate-usa.html">early estimates</a> indicate that the increase has carried over to 2021.</p><p>Violent crime is a crisis on two levels. The first, and most direct, is the toll it takes on people and communities. The lost lives, the grieving families, the traumatized children, the families and businesses that flee, leaving inequality and joblessness for those who remain.</p><p>It’s also a political crisis: Violent crime can lead to more punitive, authoritarian and often racist policies, with consequences that shape communities decades later. In the 1970s and ’80s, the politics of crime drove the rise of mass incarceration and warrior policing, the political careers of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the abandonment of inner cities. If these numbers keep rising, they could end any chance we have of building a new approach to safety, and possibly carry Donald Trump — or someone like him — back to the presidency in 2024.</p><p>There’s still time. Just this week, Philadelphia’s progressive district attorney, Larry Krasner, handily fended off a primary challenge. But the politics are changing, and fast: Democratic primary voters in New York City say crime and violence is the <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/04/21/exclusive--covid-19--crime-at-top-of-voters--minds-in-ny1-ipsos-poll">second most important problem</a> facing the city, behind the coronavirus but ahead of affordable housing and racial injustice. And just a few weeks ago, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, who was facing political challengers attacking her for being soft on crime, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/07/us/covid-crime-keisha-lance-bottoms.html">announced</a> she would not seek re-election in the fall.</p><p>So do liberals have an answer to violent crime? And if so, what is it?</p><p>James Forman Jr. is a professor of law at Yale Law School and the author <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374537449">“Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,”</a> for which he received a Pulitzer Prize. In the book, Forman uses Washington, D.C., of the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s as a case study to explore the political and psychological dynamics that rising crime produces. We discuss the toll of living amid both street and state violence; what the crime wave of the ’70s and ’80s did to Black politics; the causes of the “Great Crime Decline”; the extent to which policing and prisons actually reduce crime; why we should think of violence the way we think of pandemics; the Black community’s complex views of policing; the three-pronged approach liberals should take to safety; and much more.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092316?journalCode=criminol">“The Long Reach of Violence”</a> by Patrick Sharkey </p><p><a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2014/05/21/the-u-s-publics-support-for-being-tough-on-crime-has-been-a-main-determinant-of-changes-to-the-incarceration-rate/">“The U.S. public’s support for being tough on crime has been a main determinant of changes to the incarceration rate”</a> by Peter Enns</p><p><a href="https://www.benzevgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/17-jamaim.pdf">“Modeling Contagion Through Social Networks to Explain and Predict Gunshot Violence in Chicago, 2006 to 2014”</a> by Ben Green, Thibaut Horel, and Andrew V.

      <itunes:title>Violent Crime Is Spiking. Do Liberals Have an Answer?</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>01:14:06</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Early estimates find that in 2020, homicides in the United States increased somewhere between 25 percent and nearly 40 percent, the largest spike since 1960, when formal crime statistics began to be collected. And early estimates indicate that the increase has carried over to 2021.

Violent crime is a crisis on two levels. The first, and most direct, is the toll it takes on people and communities. The lost lives, the grieving families, the traumatized children, the families and businesses that flee, leaving inequality and joblessness for those who remain.

It’s also a political crisis: Violent crime can lead to more punitive, authoritarian and often racist policies, with consequences that shape communities decades later. In the 1970s and ’80s, the politics of crime drove the rise of mass incarceration and warrior policing, the political careers of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the abandonment of inner cities. If these numbers keep rising, they could end any chance we have of building a new approach to safety, and possibly carry Donald Trump — or someone like him — back to the presidency in 2024.

There’s still time. Just this week, Philadelphia’s progressive district attorney, Larry Krasner, handily fended off a primary challenge. But the politics are changing, and fast: Democratic primary voters in New York City say crime and violence is the second most important problem facing the city, behind the coronavirus but ahead of affordable housing and racial injustice. And just a few weeks ago, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, who was facing political challengers attacking her for being soft on crime, announced she would not seek re-election in the fall.

So do liberals have an answer to violent crime? And if so, what is it?

James Forman Jr. is a professor of law at Yale Law School and the author “Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,” for which he received a Pulitzer Prize. In the book, Forman uses Washington, D.C., of the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s as a case study to explore the political and psychological dynamics that rising crime produces. We discuss the toll of living amid both street and state violence; what the crime wave of the ’70s and ’80s did to Black politics; the causes of the “Great Crime Decline”; the extent to which policing and prisons actually reduce crime; why we should think of violence the way we think of pandemics; the Black community’s complex views of policing; the three-pronged approach liberals should take to safety; and much more.

      <title>Status Games, Polyamory and the Merits of Meritocracy</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Agnes Callard is an ethical philosopher who dissects, in dazzlingly precise detail, familiar human experiences that we think we understand. Whether her topic is expressing anger, fighting with others, jockeying for status, giving advice, or navigating jealousy, Callard provokes us to rethink the emotions and habits that govern how we live. She also happens to be one of my favorite columnists.</p><p>In this conversation, I wanted to hear what Callard had to say about a tangle of topics we’ve explored before on the show: how we measure and trade status, and how that feeds into the amorphous thing we call “the meritocracy.” Callard’s argument is that we can have a “non-punitive” meritocracy, one that rewards us for our (virtuous) successes but doesn’t blame us for our failures. I’m not so sure, but it’s a fantastic conversation I’m still thinking about.</p><p>But as they say on the infomercials — that’s not all!

      <itunes:summary>Agnes Callard is an ethical philosopher who dissects, in dazzlingly precise detail, familiar human experiences that we think we understand. Whether her topic is expressing anger, fighting with others, jockeying for status, giving advice, or navigating jealousy, Callard provokes us to rethink the emotions and habits that govern how we live. She also happens to be one of my favorite columnists.

In this conversation, I wanted to hear what Callard had to say about a tangle of topics we’ve explored before on the show: how we measure and trade status, and how that feeds into the amorphous thing we call “the meritocracy.” Callard’s argument is that we can have a “non-punitive” meritocracy, one that rewards us for our (virtuous) successes but doesn’t blame us for our failures. I’m not so sure, but it’s a fantastic conversation I’m still thinking about.

But as they say on the infomercials — that’s not all! We also talk about why advice is useless, the benefits of jealousy, whether polyamory and monogamy suffer from the same problem, sad music, why Callard’s office is such a riot of color, and the secret to a good divorce. And, at the end, I’ve got some music recommendations for you. Enjoy!

      <title>Michael Lewis Is Asking the Right Question</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Michael Lewis’s new book, <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393881554">“The Premonition,”</a> is about one of the most important questions of this moment: Why, despite having the most money, the brightest minds and the some of the most robust public health infrastructure in the world, did the United States fail so miserably at handling the Covid-19 pandemic? And what could we have done differently?</p><p>The villain of Lewis’s story is not Donald Trump; it’s the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The argument laced through the book is that the C.D.C. was too passive, too unwilling to act on uncertain information, too afraid of making mistakes, too interested in its public image. What we needed was earlier shutdowns, frank public messaging, a more decentralized testing regime, a public health bureaucracy more willing to stand up to the president.</p><p>Lewis is asking the right question, and I agree with much of his critique. But I’m skeptical of whether the kind of pandemic response he lionizes in the book was ever possible for America. Put another way: How much of a constraint is the public on public health?</p><p>Lewis and I discuss the trade-offs in pandemic prevention, why bureaucracies have such a difficult time managing catastrophic risk, the messy politics of pandemics, the lessons of the masking debate, and ultimately, what the United States needs to learn from this crisis to prepare for the next one.

      <title>Elizabeth Warren on What We Get Wrong About Inequality</title>

And two answers emerged. First, toward a truly pro-family progressivism, one that puts children’s well-being and care at the center of the agenda.

      <itunes:title>Elizabeth Warren on What We Get Wrong About Inequality</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>00:55:01</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>One lesson of covering policy over the past 20 years is that whatever Elizabeth Warren is thinking about now is what Washington is going to be talking about next.

So when I read Senator Warren’s new book, “Persist,” I read it with an eye toward that question: Where is Warren trying to drive the policy debate next? And two answers emerged. First, toward a truly pro-family progressivism, one that puts children’s well-being and care at the center of the agenda. And second, toward a view of inequality that puts wealth, not income, first, and builds a whole different set of economic priorities atop that analysis.

Warren was a policy wonk before she was a politician, and that’s the kind of conversation we had here. We discuss the drivers of the rising costs of child care, the stagnation in women’s labor force participation, whether universal day care discriminates against stay-at-home parents, Warren’s plan for fixing America’s housing crisis, whether billionaires are a policy failure, the distributional effects of canceling $50,000 in student debt, the social philosophy behind Warren’s tax proposals, how markets can be channeled toward progressive ends, the coming technologies that excite Warren, and much more.

      <title>How Chuck Schumer Plans to Win Over Trump Voters</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In his 100 days address this week, Joe Biden outlined his plans for a big, bold legislative agenda to come. He previewed a two-pronged economic package: the $2.25 trillion American Jobs Plan and the $1.8 trillion American Families Plan. He spoke about the need to pass universal background checks for firearms, comprehensive immigration reform, and the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.</p><p>The success of that agenda hinges on whether 50 Senate Democrats — ranging from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin — can come together and pass legislation. They don’t have a single vote to spare. And the person responsible for making that happens is the New York senator and Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer.</p><p>Schumer has a theory of politics that he believes can hold or even win Democrats seats in 2022. It’s not a complicated theory: For Democrats to win over middle-of-the-road voters — including those who voted for Donald Trump — they need to prove that government is actually helping them. But to do that, the government needs to actually help those voters, in clear and visible ways. That means passing big, bold legislation. And the institution Schumer leads — the Senate — is the primary obstacle to that happening.</p><p>So I invited Schumer on the show to talk about how exactly he plans on doing that. How do you win over Trump voters? What kinds of economic policies can help deliver Democrats victory in 2022? How should the party approach topics like race and gender? How will he pass bills, like the For The People Act, that can’t go through budget reconciliation?

      <title>Shame, Safety and Moving Beyond Cancel Culture</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been thinking lately about how to move beyond the binary debate over cancel culture. And a good place to start is with the deeper question we’re all trying to ask: What is the kind of politics — the kind of society — we’re trying to achieve in our fights over acceptable speech?</p><p>To talk through this question, I wanted to bring on two guests, both of whom have been canceled — one by the left and one by the right — and have since dedicated parts of their work to grappling with both the good and the bad of the phenomenon. When is cancellation merited or useful? When is it insufficient or harmful? And what other tools are available in those cases?</p><p>Natalie Wynn runs the YouTube channel ContraPoints. Her videos, on topics ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjMPJVmXxV8">cancel culture</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gDKbT_l2us">J.K. Rowling</a>, are not only intellectually stimulating and aesthetically rich but also deeply humanizing. What sets Wynn apart is a unique capacity to live inside the heads of those she disagrees with vehemently and bring them into a dialogue with her.</p><p>Will Wilkinson was the vice president for research at the Niskanen Center. He was fired after a right-wing online mob attacked a clearly satirical tweet he’d sent. Since being canceled, Wilkinson has, surprisingly, become one of the most <a href="https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/undefined-cancel-game">outspoken</a><a href="https://modelcitizen.substack.com/p/the-boring-truth-vs-cancel-culture"> critics</a> of the anti-cancel-culture discourse.

      <title>Noam Chomsky’s Theory of the Good Life</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How do you introduce Noam Chomsky? Perhaps you start here: In 1979, The New York Times<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/25/archives/the-chomsky-problem-chomsky.html"> called</a> him “arguably the most important intellectual alive today.” More than 40 years later, Chomsky, at 92, is still putting his dent in the world — writing books, giving interviews, changing minds.</p><p>There are different sides to Chomsky. He’s a world-renowned linguist who revolutionized his field. He’s a political theorist who’s been a sharp critic of American foreign policy for decades. He’s an anarchist who believes in a radically different way of ordering society. He’s a pragmatist who pushed leftists to vote for Joe Biden in 2020 and has described himself as having a “rather conservative attitude towards social change.” He is, very much, himself.</p><p>The problem in planning a conversation with Chomsky is how to get at all these different sides.

Perhaps you start here: In 1979, The New York Times called him “arguably the most important intellectual alive today.” More than 40 years later, Chomsky, at 92, is still putting his dent in the world — writing books, giving interviews, changing minds.

There are different sides to Chomsky. He’s a world-renowned linguist who revolutionized his field. He’s a political theorist who’s been a sharp critic of American foreign policy for decades. He’s an anarchist who believes in a radically different way of ordering society. He’s a pragmatist who pushed leftists to vote for Joe Biden in 2020 and has described himself as having a “rather conservative attitude towards social change.” He is, very much, himself.

The problem in planning a conversation with Chomsky is how to get at all these different sides. So this one covers a lot of ground. We discuss:

— Why Chomsky is an anarchist, and how he defines anarchism

— How his work on language informs his idea of what human beings want

— The role of advertising in capitalism

— Whether we should understand job contracts as the free market at work or a form of constant coercion

— How Chomsky’s ideal vision of society differs from Nordic social democracy

— How Chomsky’s class-based theory of politics holds up in an era where college-educated suburbanites are moving left on economics

— Chomsky’s view of the climate crisis and why he thinks the “degrowth” movement is misguided

— Whether job automation could actually be a good thing for human flourishing

— Chomsky’s views on US-China policy, and why he doesn’t think China is a major geopolitical threat

— The likelihood of nuclear war in the next decade

And much more.

      <itunes:summary>Prepping for a conversation with Tressie McMillan Cottom is intimidating. McMillan Cottom is a sociologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, a 2020 MacArthur fellow, co-host of the podcast “Hear to Slay,” and the author of the essay collection “Thick,” which was a National Book Award finalist. And she’s one of those people who can seemingly write on anything: The way for-profit colleges generate inequality, the cultural meaning of Dolly Parton, the way the U.S. medical profession treats Black women, how beauty operates in contemporary America, the role of hustle in the economy — the list just keeps going.

And so did this conversation, in the end. I barely made it through a third of my planned questions because so many interesting topics came up in each answer. We discuss the dangers of nostalgia, the social construction of smartness, the moral panics gripping America, why journalists are racing to platforms like Substack, how different mediums of communication shape our conversations, the central role status plays in American life, her research on the root causes of the uptick in “deaths of despair,” how beauty is constructed and wielded and much, much more. This is one of those conversations that could’ve gone on for four more hours.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

Recommendations:

&quot;Minor Feelings&quot; by Cathy Park Hong

&quot;Fearing the Black Body&quot; by Sabrina Strings

&quot;The Chosen&quot; by Jerome Karabel

&quot;Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry&quot; by Mildred Taylor

Filipovic and Andrews, both of whom are millennials (as am I), agree that the boomers left our generation worse off; but they disagree on just about everything else, which makes this conversation all the more interesting. We discuss the value of generational analysis, the legacy of the sexual revolution, the impact of boomer economic policies, the decline of the nuclear family, the so-called millennial sex recession, the millennial affordability crisis, the impact of pornography, how much the critique of the boomers is really a critique of technological change and much more.

      <title>The Author Behind ‘Arrival’ Doesn’t Fear AI. ‘Look at How We Treat Animals.’</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>For years, I’ve kept a list of dream guests for this show. And as long as that list has existed, Ted Chiang has been atop it.</p><p>Chiang is a science fiction writer. But that undersells him. He has released two short story collections over 20 years — 2002’s <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101972120">“Stories of Your Life and Others”</a> and 2019’s <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781101947883">“Exhalation.”</a> Those stories have won more awards than I can list, and one of them was turned into the film “Arrival.” They are remarkable pieces of work: Each is built around a profound scientific, philosophical or religious idea, and then the story or the story structure is shaped to represent that idea. They are wonders of precision and craft. But unlike a lot of science fiction, they are never cold. Chiang’s work is deeply, irrepressibly humane.</p><p>I’ve always wondered about the mind that would create Chiang’s stories. And in this conversation I got to watch it in action. Chiang doesn’t like to talk about himself. But he does like to talk about ideas. And so we do: We discuss the difference between magic and technology, why superheroes fight crime but ignore injustice, what it would do to the human psyche if we knew the future is fixed, whether free will exists, whether we’d want to know the exact date of our deaths, why Chiang fears what humans will do to artificial intelligence more than what A.I. will do to humans, the way capitalism turns people against technology, and much more.</p><p>The ideas Chiang offered in this conversation are still ringing in my head, and changing the way I see the world.

      <title>Andrew Cuomo and the Performance of Power</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Six months ago, Andrew Cuomo was on top of the world. He was touted as the anti-Donald Trump — the calm, fact-driven coronavirus leader the country needed. Now, amid allegations of hiding the true number of Covid-19 deaths in New York nursing homes and of workplace sexual harassment and abusive behavior, most of the state’s major Democratic politicians are calling for Cuomo’s resignation.</p><p>Rebecca Traister is a writer at large at New York magazine and the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Mad-Revolutionary-Power-Womens/dp/1501181793">“Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger.”</a> Last week, Traister published <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-cuomo-misconduct-allegations.html">an extraordinary piece</a> on the allegations against Cuomo. For her, the Andrew Cuomo story is a lot bigger than just Andrew Cuomo; it’s about the nature of toxic workplaces and the desire — even among Democrats — for strongmen leaders. And more than that, it’s about what we’ve been taught leadership looks like, and how the aesthetic of the tough, domineering male leader covers up, or contributes to, poor leadership.</p><p>So I wanted to bring Traister on the show to discuss the details of the Cuomo story and its broader implications. We discuss what Cuomo has actually been accused of (including Traister’s own in-depth reporting), why we often mistake bullying for leadership, what blind spots the Cuomo story reveals among liberals, the trade-offs between projecting an aesthetic of power and actually governing, why white male rage is so accepted and even admired, the parallels between Cuomo and Trump, how this story recasts reporting on Hillary Clinton and Amy Klobuchar, the double bind faced by female politicians, and much more.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode: </strong></p><p><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-cuomo-misconduct-allegations.html">"Abuse and Power"</a> by Rebecca Traister, New York magazine</p><p><strong>Recommendations: </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/House-Mirth-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486420493">"The House of Mirth"</a> by Edith Wharton</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grows-Brooklyn-Anniversary-Perennial-Classics/dp/0060736267">"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"</a> by Betty Smith</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Another-Brooklyn-Novel-Jacqueline-Woodson/dp/0062359991">"Another Brooklyn"</a> by Jacqueline Woodson</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-%C3%81ntonia-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486282406">"My Ántonia"</a> by Willa Cather</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Then-We-Came-End-Novel/dp/031601639X">"Then We Came to the End"</a> by Joshua Ferris</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Kings-Men-Warren-Acting/dp/082220018X">"All the King’s Men"</a> by Robert Penn Warren</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unbought-Unbossed-Expanded-40th-Anniversary/dp/098005902X">"Unbought and Unbossed"</a> by Shirley Chisholm</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Baby-Puffin-Picture-Books/dp/0140500480">"The Elephant and the Bad Baby"</a> by Elfrida Vipont</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Church-Mouse-Graham-Oakley/dp/1935279696">"The Church Mouse"</a> by Graham Oakley</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tar-Beach-Faith-Ringgold/dp/0517885441">"Tar Beach"</a> by Faith Ringgold</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Highway-Rat-Julia-Donaldson/dp/0545477581">"The Highway Rat"</a> by Julia Donaldson</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Ramona-Collection-Forever-Ramonas/dp/006196090X">"The Complete 8-Book Ramona Collection"</a> by Beverly Cleary</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/When-You-Reach-Yearling-Newbery/dp/0375850864">"When You Reach Me"</a> by Rebecca Stead</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Watsons-Birmingham-1963-Christopher-Paul-Curtis/dp/0385382944">"The Watsons Go to Birmingham--1963"</a> by Christopher Paul Curtis</p><p>You can find transcripts (posted midday) and more episodes of "The Ezra Klein Show" at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast">nytimes.com/ezra-klein-podcast</a>, and you can find Ezra on Twitter <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ezraklein">@ezraklein</a>.</p><p>Thoughts?

      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>01:05:02</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>Six months ago, Andrew Cuomo was on top of the world. He was touted as the anti-Donald Trump — the calm, fact-driven coronavirus leader the country needed. Now, amid allegations of hiding the true number of Covid-19 deaths in New York nursing homes and of workplace sexual harassment and abusive behavior, most of the state’s major Democratic politicians are calling for Cuomo’s resignation.

Rebecca Traister is a writer at large at New York magazine and the author of “Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women’s Anger.” Last week, Traister published an extraordinary piece on the allegations against Cuomo. For her, the Andrew Cuomo story is a lot bigger than just Andrew Cuomo; it’s about the nature of toxic workplaces and the desire — even among Democrats — for strongmen leaders. And more than that, it’s about what we’ve been taught leadership looks like, and how the aesthetic of the tough, domineering male leader covers up, or contributes to, poor leadership.

So I wanted to bring Traister on the show to discuss the details of the Cuomo story and its broader implications. We discuss what Cuomo has actually been accused of (including Traister’s own in-depth reporting), why we often mistake bullying for leadership, what blind spots the Cuomo story reveals among liberals, the trade-offs between projecting an aesthetic of power and actually governing, why white male rage is so accepted and even admired, the parallels between Cuomo and Trump, how this story recasts reporting on Hillary Clinton and Amy Klobuchar, the double bind faced by female politicians, and much more.

      <title>Mark Bittman Cooked Everything. Now He Wants to Change Everything.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mark Bittman taught me to cook. I read his New York Times cooking column, “The Minimalist,” religiously. I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Recipes-Anniversary/dp/0764578650">“How to Cook Everything,”</a> that red brick of a cookbook, and then, when I gave up meat, I bought its green companion, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Everything-Vegetarian-Meatless/dp/0764524836">“How to Cook Everything Vegetarian.”</a> He was like my cranky, no-B.S. food uncle.</p><p>But now Bittman wants to do more than teach me, or you, how to cook. He wants to convince us that the whole food system has fallen into calamity. His new book, <a href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/Animal-Vegetable-Junk/9781328971623">"Animal, Vegetable, Junk"</a> is a stunning reinterpretation of humanity’s relationship to the food it forages, grows and, nowadays, concocts. It’s about the marvel of the modern food system, which feeds more than seven billion people and offers more food, with more variety, at less cost, than ever before. But even more so, it’s about the malignancy of that food system, which is sickening us, poisoning the planet and inflicting so much suffering on other creatures that the mind breaks contemplating it.</p><p>Even as someone who is fairly critical of our modern food system, I wasn’t prepared for the scale or sweep of Bittman’s indictment. And I’m not sure I’ve bought into every piece of it. But it is bracing. And it raises profound questions about the relationship among humans, animals, plants, capitalism, technology and morality.

      <title>How America’s Covid-19 Nightmare Ends</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>On Jan. 28, I published <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/opinion/new-covid-strain.html">a column</a> that began like this: “I hope, in the end, that this article reads as alarmism. I hope that a year from now it’s a piece people point to as an overreaction.”</p><p>Today, that column, thankfully, does look like alarmism. Cases fell, and kept falling, even in places beset by new variants. The U.S. vaccination effort accelerated. And there’s going to be vastly more vaccine supply in the coming months.</p><p>Few emotions are as unnerving right now as hope. No one wants to permit themselves optimism, only to be crushed when death tolls rise. But the case for hope is strengthening. And there are important policy reasons to take that case seriously.</p><p>Dr. Ashish Jha is a physician, leading health policy researcher and dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. He’s been one of the clearest and most thoughtful voices through this crisis. And he’s feeling hopeful, too. </p><p>So I asked Jha on the show to guide us through these next months, to help us see what he’s seeing. Don’t get him, or me, wrong: This isn’t over. But in America, things are going to feel very, very different in 45 days, for reasons he explains. And then comes another question: How do we make sure the global end to this crisis comes soon after?</p><p>A note: This episode was recorded before President Biden’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/11/us/joe-biden-news#in-his-prime-time-speech-biden-will-direct-states-to-make-all-americans-eligible-for-vaccine-by-may-1" target="_blank">March 11 address</a> directing states to make all adult Americans eligible to receive Covid vaccines by no later than May 1; however, the timeline Jha and I discuss here is just as ambitious and its implications are just as promising.</p><p>This is one Covid discussion, finally, that is not going to leave you feeling in despair.</p><p><strong>Recommendations: </strong></p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LikeWar-Weaponization-P-W-Singer/dp/1328695743">"LikeWar"</a> by P.

      <itunes:duration>01:01:10</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>On Jan. 28, I published a column that began like this: “I hope, in the end, that this article reads as alarmism. I hope that a year from now it’s a piece people point to as an overreaction.”

Today, that column, thankfully, does look like alarmism. Cases fell, and kept falling, even in places beset by new variants. The U.S. vaccination effort accelerated. And there’s going to be vastly more vaccine supply in the coming months.

Few emotions are as unnerving right now as hope. No one wants to permit themselves optimism, only to be crushed when death tolls rise. But the case for hope is strengthening. And there are important policy reasons to take that case seriously.

Dr. Ashish Jha is a physician, leading health policy researcher and dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. He’s been one of the clearest and most thoughtful voices through this crisis. And he’s feeling hopeful, too. 

So I asked Jha on the show to guide us through these next months, to help us see what he’s seeing. Don’t get him, or me, wrong: This isn’t over. But in America, things are going to feel very, very different in 45 days, for reasons he explains. And then comes another question: How do we make sure the global end to this crisis comes soon after?

A note: This episode was recorded before President Biden’s March 11 address directing states to make all adult Americans eligible to receive Covid vaccines by no later than May 1; however, the timeline Jha and I discuss here is just as ambitious and its implications are just as promising.

This is one Covid discussion, finally, that is not going to leave you feeling in despair.

      <title>What Does Toxic Stress Do to Children?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Nadine Burke Harris’s pioneering work on how childhood trauma shapes adult outcomes led to her being named the first surgeon general of California. That was in 2019. And then, of course, the novel coronavirus hit. The job of California’s surgeon general in 2020 was not what it was in 2019. But in some ways, Burke Harris’s expertise was more necessary than ever.</p><p>This conversation is about the growing evidence that difficult experiences we face as children reverberate in our lives decades later. It’s profound research that should reshape how we think about social insurance, public morality and criminal justice. But it’s also a conversation about what the coronavirus has done to children — whether this year will be a trauma that marks a generation, and remakes their lives. How has it changed socialization for toddlers — like my 2-year-old son? What has it meant for children who can’t go to school, who watched their parents lose work or who had family members die alone in a hospital? How do we help them? How do we even understand what they’ve gone through, particularly when they can’t tell us?</p><p>We also discuss the lessons California learned from the early difficulties in its vaccine rollout (“simplicity saves lives,” Burke Harris says), why we need to be investing a lot more in mental health therapeutics, the debate over universal child allowances, how to address racial and income disparities in vaccine distribution, the drivers of vaccine hesitancy in Black and brown communities, what a safe path to post-pandemic reopening would look like, why Covid-19 cases have been declining across the country, and much more.</p><p>This is one of those conversations that will leave you looking at vast swaths of public policy differently.

      <itunes:duration>00:54:16</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>We were promised, with the internet, a productivity revolution. We were told that we’d get more done, in less time, with less stress. Instead, we got always-on communication, the dissolution of the boundaries between work and home, the feeling of constantly being behind, lackluster productivity numbers, and, to be fair, reaction GIFs. What went wrong?

Cal Newport is a computer scientist at Georgetown and the author of books trying to figure that out. At the center of his work is the idea that the technologies billed as offering us more productive, happier, socially rich lives have left us more exhausted, empty and stressed out than ever. He’s doing something not enough people do: questioning whether this was all worth it.

My critique of Newport’s work has always been that it focuses too much on the individual: Telling someone whose workplace communicates exclusively via Slack and email to be a “digital minimalist” is like telling someone who lives in a candy store to diet. But his new book, “A World Without Email,” is all about systems — specifically, the systems that govern how we work. In it, Newport makes a radical argument: We are living through a massive, rolling failure of markets and firms to rethink work for the digital age. But that can change. We can change it.

Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at National Review, a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a Republican wonk who is pushing his party in a more responsible, policy-centric direction. We discuss:

— Why Republicans have lost interest in policy.

— Whether Trump would have won the presidency if Senate Republicans had passed a big stimulus bill before the 2020 election.

— Why Ponnuru thinks the Republican Party’s 2024 hopefuls have learned the wrong lesson from Trump’s 2016 victory.

— The conservative case for a universal child allowance.

— Why so few Republican politicians have openly endorsed the Romney child allowance plan — and what that says about the tensions within the party’s coalition.

— What it would take for Republicans to move away from being a “business owners’” party and toward being a “parents’” party.

— Why Ponnuru thinks Republicans should support limiting, or outright banning, just-in-time scheduling practices.

— Whether there was ever a mass constituency for Paul Ryan’s version of conservatism.

— Who are the most important emerging voices on the political right today.

And much more.

We discuss whether the Texas crisis is going to be the new normal worldwide, the harrowing implications of how Texas Republicans have responded, why liberals should be cheering on Elon Musk, the difficulties liberal states are having on climate policy, the obstacles to decarbonization, the horrifying truth of what “adapting” to climate change will actually entail, why air pollution alone is a public health crisis worth solving, whether nuclear energy is the answer, and much more. I learned so much getting to sit in on this conversation. You will, too.

“Migration towards Bangladesh coastlines projected to increase with sea level rise through 2100” by AR Bell, et al.

“Inequity in consumption of goods and services adds to racial–ethnic disparities in air pollution exposure” by Christopher W. Tessum, et al.

“Prisoners of the Wrong Dilemma: Why Distributive Conflict, Not Collective Action, Characterizes the Politics of Climate Change” by Michaël Aklin and Matto Mildenberger

      <itunes:subtitle>Last week, freezing temperatures overwhelmed the Texas power grid, setting off rolling blackouts that left millions without power during an intense winter storm. But this story is a lot bigger than Texas: Our world is built around a model of the climate from the 19th and 20th centuries. Global warming is going to crack that model apart, and with it, much of the physical and political infrastructure civilization relies on.

At the same time, there’s good news on the climate front, too. The Biden administration has rejoined the Paris climate accords, pushed through a blitz of executive orders on the environment, and is planning a multitrillion-dollar climate bill. China has also set newly ambitious targets for decarbonization. Renewable energy is getting cheaper, faster, than almost anyone dared hope. And if you follow climate models, you know the most catastrophic outcomes have become less likely in recent years.

I wanted to have a conversation about both the emergency in Texas, and the broader picture on climate. Leah Stokes is a political scientist at University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of the excellent book “Short Circuiting Policy,” which, among other things, explores Texas’ surprising history with renewables. David Wallace-Wells is an editor at large at New York magazine and author of &quot;The Uninhabitable Earth,&quot; one of the most sobering, disquieting portraits of our future — though he is, as you’ll hear in this discussion, getting a bit more optimistic.

      <title>What It Means to be Kind in a Cruel World</title>

      <itunes:subtitle>George Saunders is one of America’s greatest living writers. He’s the author of dozens of critically acclaimed short stories, including his 2013 collection, “Tenth of December”; his debut novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo,” won the 2017 Booker Prize; and his nonfiction work has empathy and insight that leave pieces from more than a decade ago ringing in my head today. His most recent book, “A Swim in A Pond in the Rain,” is a literary master class built around seven Russian short stories, analyzing how they work, and what they reveal about how we work.

I’ve wanted to interview Saunders for more than 15 years. I first saw him talk when I was in college, and there was a quality of compassion and consideration in every response that was, well, strange. His voice doesn’t sound like his fiction. His fiction is bitingly satirical, manic, often unsettling. His voice is calm, kind, gracious. The dissonance stuck with me.

Saunders’s central topic, literalized in his famous 2013 commencement speech, is about what it means to be kind in an unkind world. And that’s the organizing question of this conversation, too. We discuss the collisions between capitalism and human relations, the relationship between writing and meditation, Saunders’s personal editing process, the tension between empathizing with others and holding them to account, the promise of re-localizing our politics, the way our minds deceive us, Tolstoy’s unusual theory of personal transformation, and much more.

What a pleasure this conversation was. So worth the wait.

      <title>What ‘Drained-Pool’ Politics Costs America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“The American landscape was once graced with resplendent public swimming pools, some big enough to hold thousands of swimmers at a time,” writes Heather McGhee in her new book, <a href="https://www.oneworldlit.com/books/the-sum-of-us-hc" target="_blank">“The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together.”</a> These pools were the pride of their communities, monuments to what public investment could do. But they were, in many places, whites-only. Then came the desegregation orders. The pools would need to be open to everyone. But these communities found a loophole.

But it’s too easily dismissed as yet one more story of America’s racist past. McGhee shows otherwise. Drained-pool politics are still with us today and shaping issues of far more consequence than pool access. Drained-pool politics — if “they” can also have it, then no one can — helps explain why America still doesn’t have a truly universal health care system, a child care system, a decent social safety net.

      <title>Should We Dim the Sun? Will We Even Have a Choice?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>“We are as gods and might as well get good at it,” Stewart Brand famously wrote in “The Whole Earth Catalogue.” Human beings act upon nature at fantastic scale, altering whole ecosystems, terraforming the world to our purposes, breeding new species into existence and driving countless more into extinction. The power we wield is awesome. But Brand was overly optimistic. We did not get good at it. We are terrible at it, and the consequences surround us.</p><p>That’s the central theme of the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Under-White-Sky-Nature-Future/dp/0593136276">“Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future.”</a> And yet, there is no going back.

The power we wield is awesome. But Brand was overly optimistic. We did not get good at it. We are terrible at it, and the consequences surround us.

That’s the central theme of the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and journalist Elizabeth Kolbert’s new book, “Under a White Sky: The Nature of the Future.” And yet, there is no going back. We will not return to a prelapsarian period where humans let nature alone. Indeed, as Kolbert shows, there is no natural nature left — we live in the world (and in particular, a climate) we altered, and are altering. The awful knowledge that our interventions have gone awry again and again must be paired with the awful reality that we have no choice save to try to manage the mess we have made.

And yet, any reasonable analysis of the mismatch between our glacial politics and our rapidly warming planet demands that we deny ourselves the luxury of only contemplating the solutions we would prefer. With every subsequent day that our politics fails, the choices that we will need to make in the future become worse.

This is a conversation about some of the difficult trade-offs and suboptimal options that we are left with in what Kolbert describes as a “no-analog moment.” We discuss the prospect of intentionally sending sulfurous particles into the atmosphere to dim the sun, whether “carbon capture” technology could scale up to the levels needed to make a dent in emissions levels, the ethics of using gene editing technologies to make endangered species more resistant to climate change, the governance mechanisms needed to prevent these technologies from getting out of hand, what a healthier narrative about humanity’s relationship with nature would sound like, how the pandemic altered carbon emissions, and more.

At the end, we discuss another fascinating question that Kolbert wrote about recently in The New Yorker: Why is a Harvard astrophysicist arguing Earth has already been visited by aliens, and should we believe him?

      <title>An Appalled Republican Considers the Future of the G.O.P.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>"I don’t think conservatism can do its job in a free society in opposition to the institutions of that society,” Yuval Levin told me. “I think it can only function in defense of them.”</p><p>Levin is the director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the author of a number of great books, most recently, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Build-Community-Recommitting-Institutions/dp/1541699270" target="_blank">“A Time to Build.”</a> I wanted to talk to him about a very specific question, though: What will the Republican Party become? Levin is one of its most thoughtful and sober analysts — a temperament that may, I realize, make him unsuited to interpreting its current incarnation, in which a majority of House Republicans voted to reject the results of the 2020 presidential election and one of them is, well, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/01/opinion/marjorie-taylor-greene-gop.html" target="_blank">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>.</p><p>But Levin’s diagnosis is interesting. Histories of the modern Republican Party often place Ronald Reagan at their center. That is, in Levin’s view, a mistake. “I think Reagan is better understood as a detour from a history that is otherwise a story of a constant struggle between populism and conservatism,” he said. Donald Trump was an inheritor of a tradition that stretches long before him — Pat Buchanan’s tradition, and Strom Thurmond’s tradition. He didn’t form a new Republican Party; he allowed a long-existing part to express itself.</p><p>Behind that lie institutional changes both in the Republican Party and in the broader structure of American politics. That’s why I wanted to talk to Levin for this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show”: He, like me, thinks in terms of institutions. “The question for us in the coming years is whether we can move a little more in the direction of a politics of ‘what does government do,’ and less of a politics of ‘who rules,’” he says.</p><p>That’s exactly the right question, in my view. But we have very different views of what kinds of institutional changes would get us there. I’d like to see a more democratized, majoritarian system. Levin would, among other things, add a filibuster to the House.</p><p>So this is more than just a conversation about how to fix the Republican Party. It’s a conversation about how to fix American politics — how to recenter it on policy that changes people’s lives, rather than symbolic clashes that merely harden our hearts.</p><p><strong>Mentioned in this episode:</strong></p><p>“<a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/big-tech-big-government-challenges-regulating-internet-platforms">Big Tech, Big Government: The Challenges of Regulating Internet Platforms</a>,” National Affairs, Winter 2021</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Working-Class-Republican-Blue-Collar-Conservatism/dp/0062475266">The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism </a>by Henry Olsen</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/opinion/biden-inauguration-democrats.html">"Democrats, Here’s How to Lose in 2022.

      <itunes:title>An Appalled Republican Considers the Future of the G.O.P.</itunes:title>

      <itunes:summary>&quot;I don’t think conservatism can do its job in a free society in opposition to the institutions of that society,” Yuval Levin told me. “I think it can only function in defense of them.”

Levin is the director of social, cultural and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the author of a number of great books, most recently, “A Time to Build.” I wanted to talk to him about a very specific question, though: What will the Republican Party become? Levin is one of its most thoughtful and sober analysts — a temperament that may, I realize, make him unsuited to interpreting its current incarnation, in which a majority of House Republicans voted to reject the results of the 2020 presidential election and one of them is, well, Marjorie Taylor Greene.

But Levin’s diagnosis is interesting. Histories of the modern Republican Party often place Ronald Reagan at their center. That is, in Levin’s view, a mistake. “I think Reagan is better understood as a detour from a history that is otherwise a story of a constant struggle between populism and conservatism,” he said. Donald Trump was an inheritor of a tradition that stretches long before him — Pat Buchanan’s tradition, and Strom Thurmond’s tradition. He didn’t form a new Republican Party; he allowed a long-existing part to express itself.

Behind that lie institutional changes both in the Republican Party and in the broader structure of American politics. That’s why I wanted to talk to Levin for this episode of “The Ezra Klein Show”: He, like me, thinks in terms of institutions. “The question for us in the coming years is whether we can move a little more in the direction of a politics of ‘what does government do,’ and less of a politics of ‘who rules,’” he says.

That’s exactly the right question, in my view. But we have very different views of what kinds of institutional changes would get us there. I’d like to see a more democratized, majoritarian system. Levin would, among other things, add a filibuster to the House.

So this is more than just a conversation about how to fix the Republican Party. It’s a conversation about how to fix American politics — how to recenter it on policy that changes people’s lives, rather than symbolic clashes that merely harden our hearts.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration’s first legislative priority is a $1.9 trillion economic rescue package.
