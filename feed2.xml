<title>The Ezra Klein Show</title>
<description>*** Named a best podcast of 2021 by Time, Vulture and Esquire. *** Each Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation on something that matters. How do we address climate change if the political system fails to act? Has the logic of markets infiltrated too many aspects of our lives? What is the future of the Republican Party? What do psychedelics teach us about consciousness? What does sci-fi understand about our present that we miss? Can our food system be just to humans and animals alike?</description>

<title>Best Of: This Conversation Will Change How You Think About Thinking</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[ <p>For decades, our society's dominant metaphor for the mind has been a computer. A machine that operates the exact same way whether it's in a dark room or next to a sunny window, whether it's been working for 30 seconds or three hours, whether it's near other computers or completely alone.</p><p>But that's wrong. Annie Murphy Paul's “<a href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/the-extended-mind/9780544947665">The Extended Mind”</a> argues, convincingly, that the human mind is contextual. It works differently in different environments, with different tools, amid different bodily states, among other minds.</p><p>Here's the problem: Our schools, our workplaces, our society are built atop that bad metaphor. Activities and habits that we've been taught to associate with creativity and efficiency often stunt our thinking, and so much that we've been taught to dismiss — activities that look like leisure, play or rest — are crucial to thinking (and living!) well.</p><p>Paul's book, read correctly, is a radical critique of not just how we think about thinking, but how we've constructed much of our society. In this conversation, originally released in July 2021, we discuss how the body can pick up on patterns before the conscious mind knows what it's seen, why forcing kids (and adults) to “sit still” makes it harder for them to think clearly, the connection between physical movement and creativity, why efficiency is often the enemy of productivity, the restorative power of exposure to the natural world, the dystopian implications of massive cognitive inequality, why open-plan offices were a terrible idea and much more.</p><p>Mentioned: </p><p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/CLATEM">"The extended mind"</a> by Andy Clark and David J.
